Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,"Target 1.1: By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day","Indicator 1.1.1: Proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural)","The indicator Proportion of population below the international poverty line is defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. The 'international poverty line' is currently set at $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. To measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank's international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what  poverty  means in the world's poorest countries. The original  $1-a-day  line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a new compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day. This is the average poverty line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set. The current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. When measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $'s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years."
Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,"Target 1.1: By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day","Indicator 1.1.1: Proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural)","The proportion of the employed population below the international poverty line of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty rate, is defined as the share of employed persons living in households with per-capita consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.90.

Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,"Target 1.2: By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions","Indicator 1.2.1: Proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age","The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living below the national poverty line. The rural poverty rate is the percentage of the rural population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate, rural poverty line is used, the rural poverty line). Urban poverty rate is the percentage of the urban population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate, urban poverty line is used, the urban poverty line). The formula for calculating the proportion of the total, urban and rural population living below the national poverty line, or headcount index, is as follows:Where  is an indicator function that takes on a value of 1 if the bracketed expression is true, and 0 otherwise. If individual consumption or income  is less than the national poverty line (for example, in absolute terms the line could be the price of a consumption bundle or in relative terms a percentage of the income distribution), then  is equal to 1 and the individual is counted as poor.  is the total, urban or rural number of poor. is the total, urban or rural population. Consumption or income data are gathered from nationally representative household surveys, which contain detailed responses to questions regarding spending habits and sources of income. Consumption, including consumption from own production, or income is calculated for the entire household. In some cases, an  effective  household size is calculated from the actual household size to reflect assumed efficiencies in consumption; adjustments may also be made to reflect the number of children in a household. The number of people in those households is aggregated to estimate the number of poor persons. National poverty rates use a country specific poverty line, reflecting the country's economic and social circumstances. In some case, the national poverty line is adjusted for different areas (such as urban and rural) within the country, to account for differences in prices or the availability of goods and services. Typically the urban poverty line is set higher than the rural poverty line; reflecting the relatively higher costs of living in urban areas."
Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,"Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.","Indicator 1.3.1: Percentage of the population covered by social protection floors/systems disaggregated by sex, and distinguishing children, unemployed, old age, people with disabilities, pregnant women/new-borns, work injury victims, poor and vulnerable","The indicator reflects the proportion of persons effectively covered by a social protection system, including social protection floors. It also reflects the main components of social protection: child and maternity benefits, support for persons without a job, persons with disabilities, victims of work injuries and older persons. Effective coverage of social protection is measured by the number of people who are either actively contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving benefits (contributory or non-contributory).Calculations include separate indicators in order to distinguish effective coverage for children, unemployed persons, older persons and persons with disabilities, mothers with newborns, workers protected in case of work injury, and the poor and the vulnerable.  For each case, coverage expressed as a share of the respective population.Indicators are obtained as follows:Proportion of children covered by social protection benefits: ratio of children/households receiving child or family cash benefits to the total number of children/households with children.Proportion of women giving birth covered by maternity benefits: ratio of women receiving cash maternity benefits to women giving birth in the same year (estimated based on age-specific fertility rates published in the UN's World Population Prospects or on the number of live births corrected for the share of twin and triplet births).Proportion of persons with disabilities receiving benefits: ratio of persons receiving disability cash benefits to persons with severe disabilities. The latter is calculated as the product of prevalence of disability ratios (published for each country group by the World Health Organization) and each country's population.Proportion of unemployed receiving benefits: ratio of recipients of unemployment cash benefits to the number of unemployed persons.Proportion of workers covered in case of employment injury: ratio of workers protected by injury insurance to total employment or the labour force. Proportion of older persons receiving a pension: ratio of persons above statutory retirement age receiving an old-age pension to persons above statutory retirement age (including contributory and non-contributory).Proportion of vulnerable persons receiving benefits: ratio of social assistance recipients to the total number of vulnerable persons. The latter are calculated by subtracting from total population all people of working age who are contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving contributory benefits, and all persons above retirement age receiving contributory benefits.The aggregate indicator is calculated as the proportion of the total population receiving cash benefits under at least one of the contingencies (contributory or non-contributory benefit) or actively contributing to at least one social security scheme."
Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,"Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable","Indicator 1.3.1: Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable","Coverage of social protection and labor programs (SPL) is the percentage of population participating in social insurance, social safety net, and unemployment benefits and active labor market programs. Estimates include both direct and indirect beneficiaries.Data are calculated from national representative household surveys using ASPIRE: The Atlas of Social Protection - Indicators of Resilience and Equity, The World Bank (see datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/). Coverage = Number of beneficiaries in the total population (or group) / Total population (or group). Generally, ASPIRE indicators are based on a first level analysis of original household survey data (with no imputations) and on a unified methodology that does not necessarily reflect country-specific knowledge and in depth country analysis relying on different data sources (administrative program level data)."
Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,"Target 1.4:  By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance",Indicator 1.4.1: Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services,"The following key concepts were defined to support the indicator in the context of poverty eradication. Basic Services refer to public service provision systems that meet human basic needs including drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, energy, mobility, waste collection, health care, education and information technologies.Access to basic services: implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate quality.Access to Basic Drinking Water Services refers to drinking water from an improved source is available with collection time not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queuing. Improved sources include; piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on SDG indicator 6.1.Access to Basic Sanitation Services refers to the use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households. Improved facilities include flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with slabs. This definition is based on SDG 6.2.Access to Basic Hygiene Facilities refers to availability of a handwashing facility on premises with soap and water. Handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water, buckets with taps, tippy-taps, and jugs or basins designated for handwashing. Soap includes bar soap, liquid soap, powder detergent, and soapy water but does not include ash, soil, sand or other handwashing agents. This definition is based on SDG 6.2.Access to Basic Mobility refers to having access to all-weather-roads in a rural context (SDG 9.1.1) or having access to public transport in an urban context (SDG 11.2.1).  The computation of  Access to Basic Mobility  shall therefore be a combination of the above. Rural context:To synergize with SDG indicator 9.1.1  Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road , it was suggested to use the Rural Access Index (RAI) that measures the percentage of the population <2km from an all-season road (equivalent to a walk of 20-25 mins). To eradicate poverty, communities need to be connected to socio-economic opportunities by roads that are passable all season and attract reliable and affordable public transport services. In many areas, safe footpaths, footbridges and waterways may be required in conjunction with, or as an alternative, to roads. For reasons of simplification, specific emphasis was given to roads in this definition (based on the Rural Access Index - RAI) since road transport reflects accessibility for the great majority of people in rural contexts. In those situations where another mode, such as water transport is dominant the definition will be modified and contextualized to reflect and capture those aspects. Access to mobility has shown some of the largest impacts on poverty reduction and has a strong correlation to educational, economic and health outcomes ( transport as an enabler ).   The existing RAI methodology relies on household level survey data – however, is currently being revised into a GIS-based index that exploits advances in digital technology with the aim to create a more accurate and cost-effective tool. As a basic underlying assumption, it is understood that women and men equally benefit from access to all-weather roads. Urban Context:The urban context of access to transport is measured utilizing the methodology of SDG 11.2.1 –the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport by sex, age and persons with disabilities . The metadata methodology is available (UN-Habitat being the custodian agency) and uses a combination of spatial and qualitative analysis. A 500 m buffer around each public transport stop is used and overlaid with socio-demographic data – in order to identify the population served. We know that measuring spatial access is not sufficient and does not address the temporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. Complementary to the above, other parameters of tracking the transport target related to street density/ no. of intersections, affordability, or quality in terms of safety, travel time, universal access, are all tracked. Access to Basic Waste Collection Services refers to the access that the population have to a reliable waste collection service, including both formal municipal and informal sector services. A 'collection service' may be 'door to door' or by deposit into a community container. 'Collection' includes collection for recycling as well as for treatment and disposal (so includes e.g. collection of recyclables by itinerant waste buyers). 'Reliable' means regular - frequency will depend on local conditions and on any pre-separation of the waste. For example, both mixed waste and organic waste are often collected daily in tropical climates for public health reasons, and generally at least weekly; source-separated dry recyclables may be collected less frequently.Access to Basic Health Care Services refers to access to services that cover in and out-of-area emergency services, inpatient hospital and physician care, outpatient medical services, laboratory and radiology services, and preventive health services. Basic health care services also extend to access to limited treatment of mental illness and substance abuse in accordance with minimum standards prescribed by local and national ministries of health.Access to Basic Education refers to access to education services that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. For this indicator we examine access to education services in the school going age of 5 – 21 years of pupils. The right to education is a multi-faceted right that has at least two dimensions that need to be fulfilled: (a) quantitative (for everyone), (b) qualitative (right to what education, for how long, provided by whom and for whom and also leading to full development of the human personality fundamental to the fulfilment of other rights, freedom and maintenance of peace. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human rights (1948) note that: Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.Access to Basic Information Services refers to having a broadband internet access. Broadband is defined as technologies that deliver advertised download speeds of at least 256 kbit/s. The main types of broadband services are: 1) Fixed (wired) broadband network, such as DSL, cable modem, high speed leased lines, fibre to- the-home/building, powerline and other fixed (wired) broadband; 2) Terrestrial fixed (wireless) broadband network, such as WiMAX, fixed CDMA; 3) Satellite broadband network (via a satellite connection); 4) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a handset and 5) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a card (e.g. integrated SIM card in a computer) or USB modem.Comments and limitations:Different local characteristics of what constitutes as basic service around the world by some concerned authorities and stakeholders compelled the team to work on modules and global guides for this indicator. This draws on definitions available for many other SDG indicators. For example, elements of basic services are measured under indicators 3.7.1 (health), 4.1.1 (education), 6.1.1 (water), 6.2.1 (sanitation), 7.1.1 (energy), 11.2.1 (public transport), etc.  Finally, many countries still have limited capacities for data management, data collection and monitoring, and continue to struggle with limited data on large or densely populated geographical areas. This means that complementarity in data reporting in a few exceptions is needed to ensure that both national and global figures achieve consistencies in the final reported data for access to basic services.MethodologyComputation Method:There are two computation stages that we have applied depending on the level at which data is collected.  Step 1 is getting proportion of population that have access to ALL the basic services mentioned above from primary data sources such as household surveys and census. Proportion of Population with access to basic services  Example: Proportion of population with access to (all) basic services = 5/(4+7+5+6+3) x 100 = 20%This step is essential when countries have primary data at the household levels for all the types of basic services. This is then followed by computations of metrics for other components that are not measured at the household level such as access to health, education, transport, etc. For example, access to mobility for households is measured through GIS data rather than household survey. Individual components of access to basic services are computed first, followed by an aggregation of the components with no weights. From pilots, having an aggregated value showing access to ALL the basic services works as the best measure to inform policies of regions where the most deprivations are prevalent, but is not actionable. Instead, it's the individual component measures that point rightly to areas of improvements or investments. Data presentationData for this component-based indicator is now modelled and presented or visualized as a spider web of the achievement of access to different basic services in a country through plotting the various components of the indicator which also doubles as other SDG indicators. In this way policy makers can be informed of most needed intervention areas. This data presentation methodology does not necessarily have a single aggregated value against 'proportion of population with access to basic services'. The figure below is an example of the outcomes. "
Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,"Target 1.4: By 2030, aims to ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.","Indicator 1.4.2: Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, with legally recognized documentation, and who perceive their rights to land as secure, by sex and by type of tenure","Indicator 1.4.2 measures the relevant part of Target 1.4 (ensure men and women have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to …, ownership of and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources). It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure security for all, including women and other vulnerable groups.Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land, customary land. An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as member of group, cooperative or other type of association. Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure security. Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by government, and is therefore official.  For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized (see next section for rationale). Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual's perception of the likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without land rights' documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land tenure security, based on a country specific context.  For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section 3.1 for rationale), we define perceptions of tenure to be secure if: The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land. Total adult population:  A country's adult population is measured by census data or through surveys using an adequate sample frame.  Indicator 1.4.2 is composed of two parts: (A) measures the incidence of adults with legally recognized documentation over land among the total adult population; while (B) focuses on the incidence of adults who report having perceived secure rights to land among the adult population. Part (A) and part (B) provide two complementary data sets on security of tenure rights, needed for measuring the indicator. Part (A):   X 100Part (B):  x 100Part A will be computed using national census data or household survey data generated by the national statistical system and/or administrative data generated by land agency (depending on data availability). Part B will be computed using national census data or household survey data that feature the perception questions globally agreed through the EGMs and standardized in a module with essential questions discussed in section 5.1.1). The indicator gives equal weight to both components."

One of the targets is:  Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020 .In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG ). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators.Member States count the number of local governments that adopt and implement local DRR strategies in line with the national strategy and express it as a percentage of the total number of local governments in the country.Local governments are determined by the reporting country for this indicator, considering sub-national public administrations with responsibility to develop local disaster risk reduction strategies. It is recommended that countries report on progress made by the lowest level of government accorded the mandate for disaster risk reduction, as the Sendai Framework promotes the adoption and implementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies in every local authority.Each Member State will calculate the ratio of the number of local governments with local DRR strategies in line with national strategies and the total number of local governments.Global Average will then be calculated as below through arithmetic average of the data from each Member State.

Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries,"Target 10.1: By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average",Indicator 10.1.1: Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40 per cent of the population and the total population,"The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of bottom 40% is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period. The national average growth rate in the welfare aggregate is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the total population in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period.Growth rates are calculated as annualized average growth rates over a roughly five-year period. Since many countries do not conduct surveys on a precise five-year schedule, the following rules guide selection of the survey years used to calculate the growth rates in the 2015 update: the final year of the growth period (T1) is the most recent year of a survey but no earlier than 2010, and the initial year (T0) is as close to T1 – 5 as possible, within a two-year band. Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 – 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year.Once two surveys are selected for a country, the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption is computed by first estimating the mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in years T0 and T1 and then computing the annual average growth rate between those years using a compound growth formula, (Mean in T_1)/(Mean in T_0 )?^(1/( T_1- T_0 ))-1. Growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the total population is computed in the same way using data for the total population."
Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries,"Target 10.2: By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status","Indicator 10.2.1 Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","The proportion of people living below 50 percent of median income (or consumption) is the share (%) of a country's population living on less than half of the consumption/income level of the median of the national income/consumption distribution. The indicator is measured using the national distribution per capita measure of consumption or income, as derived from surveys. The indicator is calculated by estimating the share (in percent) of the population living on less than 50% of median of the national distribution of income or consumption. The median is estimate from the same distribution as the indicator is estimated from, thus the 50% of median threshold will vary over time.  Per capita income or consumption is estimated using total household income or consumption divided by the total household size. "
Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries,"Target 10.3: Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard",Indicator 10.3.1: Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law,"This indicator is defined as the proportion of the population (adults) who self-report that they personally experienced discrimination or harassment during the last 12 months based on ground(s) prohibited by international human rights law. International human rights law refers to the body of international legal instruments aiming to promote and protect human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations.Number of survey respondents who felt that they personally experienced discrimination or harassment on one or more prohibited grounds of discrimination during the last 12 months, divided by the total number of survey respondents, multiplied by 100.To minimize the effect of forward telescoping, the module asks two questions: a first question about the respondent's experience over the last 5 years, and a second question about the last 12 months:Question 1: In [COUNTRY], do you feel that you personally experienced any form of discrimination or harassment during the last 5 years, namely since [YEAR OF INTERVIEW MINUS 5] (or since you have been in the country), on the following grounds?Question 2: In [COUNTRY], do you feel that you  personally experienced any form of discrimination or harassment during the past 12 months, namely since [MONTH OF INTERVIEW] [YEAR OF INTERVIEW MINUS 1], on any of these grounds?The proposed survey module recommends that interviewer reads or the data collection mechanism provides a short definition of discrimination/harassment to the respondent before asking the questions. Providing respondents with a basic introduction to these notions helps improve their comprehension and recall of incidents. Following consultations with experts and complementary cognitive testing, the following introductory text is recommended: Discrimination happens when you are treated less favourably compared to others or harassed because of the way you look, where you come from, what you believe or for other reasons. You may be refused equal access to work, housing, healthcare, education, marriage or family life, the police or justice system, shops, restaurants, or any other services or opportunities. You may also encounter comments, gestures or other behaviours that make you feel offended, threatened or insulted, or have to stay away from places or activities to avoid such behaviours.The proposed survey module also recommends that a list of grounds is provided to respondents to facilitate comprehension and recall of incidents. As a starting point, OHCHR recommends the use of the following list of grounds prohibited by international human rights law and adding an  any other ground  category to capture grounds that are not explicitly listed.

It provides information about the relative share of output which is paid as compensation to employees as compared with the share paid to capital in the production process for a given reference period.Labour share of Gross Domestic Product = Total compensation of employees / Gross Domestic Product * 100As mentioned above, this calculation method does not provide a comprehensive measure of the labour income share, as it does not take into account the labour income of the self-employed. Ideally, wherever possible, the numerator should be adjusted to include not only compensation of employees, but earnings of the self-employed as well."
Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries,Target 10.5: Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and strengthen the implementation of such regulations,Indicator 10.5.1: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs),"Seven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent.1	- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets 2	- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets 3	- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital 4	- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans 5	- Return on assets 6	- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities 7	- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) assets.   Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as the denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  Nonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  Return on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  Liquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as the numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, this indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. Net open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.  The calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on  Definition  above. The common source data are data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.  "

The information collected seeks to identify both progress made and gaps, thus contributing to the evidence base for actionable recommendations for the implementation of SDG target 10.7. The indicator will also serve for the future thematic reviews at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The conceptual framework for indicator 10.7.2 is IOM´s Migration Governance Framework (MiGOF), which was welcomed by 157 countries (IOM Council Resolution C/106/RES/1310). The MiGOF has three principles and three objectives (figure 1). Figure 1. Principles and objectives of the Migration Governance FrameworkThe three principles propose the necessary conditions for migration to be well-managed by creating a more effective environment for maximized results for migration to be beneficial to all. These represent the means through which a State will ensure that the systemic requirements for good migration governance are in place. The three objectives are specific and do not require any further conventions, laws or practices than the ones that are already existing. Taken together, these objectives ensure that migration is governed in an integrated and holistic way, responding to the need to consider mobile categories of people and address their needs for assistance in the event of an emergency, building resilience of individuals and communities, as well as ensuring opportunities for the economic and social health of the State.In line with the MiGOF, the proposed methodology for SDG indicator 10.7.2 is comprised of six policy domains, with one proxy measure for each domain (table 1). Table 1. Domains and proxy measures for SDG indicator 10.7.2For each of the domains and corresponding proxy measures, one question was specified, each one of them informed by five subcategories or responses (table 2), to capture key aspects of the range of migration policies at the national level, while allowing the indicator to detect relevant variations across countries and over time.Table 2. Questions and subcategories for SDG indicator 10.7.2The indicator includes a total of 30 subcategories, under 6 questions/domains. All subcategories, except for those under domain 1, have dichotomous  Yes/No  answers, coded  1  for  Yes  and  0  for  No . For the subcategories under domain 1, there are three possible answers:  Yes, regardless of immigration status , coded  1 ;  Yes, only for those with legal immigration status , coded  0.5 ; and  No  coded  0 .For each domain, the computational methodology is the unweighted average of the subcategories under each domain: 100Where  refers to domain i;  refers to the sum of the subcategories j under domain i; and n refers to the total number of subcategories in each domain. Results are reported as percentages. For each domain, values range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100 per cent.The overall synthetic indicator 10.7.2 is obtained by computing the unweighted average of the values of the 30 subcategories under the six domains, with values ranging between 0 and 100 per cent. For ease of interpretation and to summarize results, the resulting averages are then recategorized as follows: values of less than 40 per cent are coded as  Requires further progress ; values of 40 per cent to less than 80 per cent are coded as  Partially meets , and values of 80 per cent or more are coded as  Meets or fully meets .

Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries,"Target 10.c: By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent",Indicator 10.c.1: Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount remitted,"The target includes two components. The first component is that transaction costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This transaction cost should be intended as  Global average total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount sent . This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.Data is collected through a mystery shopping exercise of remittance service providers (RSPs). A sample of RSPs including at least 80% of the market share in each corridor are included in the mystery shopping exercise. The average cost is calculated as the simple average of total costs (including both fee and exchange rate margin) quoted by each RSP operating in a corridor.In 2016, introduced the Smart Remitter Target (SmarRT) to monitor remittance transactions at a more granular level. It aims to reflect the cost that a savvy consumer with access to sufficiently complete information would pay to transfer remittances in each corridor. SmaRT is calculated as the simple average as the three cheapest services for sending the equivalent of $200 in each corridor and is expressed in terms of the percentage of the total amount sent. In addition to transparency, services must meet additional criteria to be included in SmaRT, including transaction speed (5 days or less) and accessibility (determined by geographic proximity of branches for services that require physical presence, or access to any technology or device necessary to use the service, such as a bank account, mobile phone or the internet. For additional information on the methodology of SmaRT, please see:  Target 10.c.1 includes two components, which require two separate calculations:Global average of remittance costs to be reduced to less than 3 percent: this is calculated as the simple average of the total cost for all services included in the RPW databaseEnabling remittance senders in all corridors to send money to their receivers at a cost of 5 percent or less: this is calculated as the average cost of the three cheapest available services in each corridor which meet a defined set of minimum requirements, as described in the World Bank SmaRT methodology. The target is that the SmaRT average for all corridors should be 5 percent or lower."
"Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","Target 11.1: By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums","Indicator 11.1.1: Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing","As per the 2030 Agenda, to guide the development of the appropriate policies and programmes for ensuring access for all to adequate housing and the upgrading of slums, it is necessary to identify and quantify the proportion of the population that live in slums, informal settlements and those living in inadequate housing. a. Slums – An expert group meeting was convened in 2002 by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Statistics Division and the Cities Alliance to agree on an operational definition for slums to be used for measuring the indicator of MDG 7 Target 7.D. The agreed definition classified a 'slum household' as one in which the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following 'household deprivations':Lack of access to improved water source,Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, Lack of sufficient living area, Lack of housing durability and,Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term 'slum dweller' refers to a person living in a household that lacks any of the above attributes.These five components –all derived from the adequate housing's definition have been used ever since for reporting and tracking of the MDGs, as the primary or secondary data measured to determine the number of slum dwellers living in developing countries. They were also the basis to establish the successful achievement of MDG Target 7.D. For each component, the experts agreed with the following sub-definitions:1) Access to improved water – A household is considered to have access to improved drinking water if it has sufficient amount of water (20 litres/person/day) for family use, at an affordable price (less than 10% of the total household income) and available to household members without being subject to extreme effort (less than one hour a day for the minimum sufficient quantity), especially to women and children. An improved drinking water source is a facility that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from faecal matters' contamination. Improved drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/stand pipe serving no more than 5 households; protected spring; rainwater collection; bottled water (if secondary source is also improved); bore hole/tube well; and, protected dug well.2) Access to improved sanitation – A household is considered to have access to improved sanitation if an excreta disposal system, either in the form of a private toilet or a public toilet shared with a reasonable number of people, is available to household members. Such improved sanitation facilities, therefore, hygienically separates human waste from human contact. Improved facilities include: flush/pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform, which covers the pit entirely; and, composting toilets/latrines.3) Sufficient living area /overcrowding– A dwelling unit provides sufficient living area for the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room. Additional indicators of overcrowding have been proposed: area-level indicators such as average in-house living area per person or the number of households per area. Additionally, housing-unit level indicators such as the number of persons per bed or the number of children under five per room may also be viable. However, the number of persons per room has been shown to correlate with adverse health risks and is more commonly collected through household survey.. UN-Habitat believes that the definition as it stands does not reflect the practical experience of overcrowding and as noted below, is proposing an alternative. Figure 1- Example of Overcrowding4) Structural quality/durability of dwellings – A house is considered as 'durable' if it is built on a non-hazardous location and has a permanent and adequate structure able to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions such as rain, heat, cold, and humidity. The following criteria are used to determine the structural quality/durability of dwellings: permanency of structure (permanent building material for the walls, roof and floor; compliance with building codes; the dwelling is not in a dilapidated state; the dwelling is not in need of major repair); and location of house (hazardous location; the dwelling is not located on or near toxic waste; the dwelling is not located in a flood plain; the dwelling is not located on a steep slope; the dwelling is not located in a dangerous right of way: rail, highway, airport, power lines).5) Security of tenure – Secure tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective protection by the State against forced evictions. Security of tenure is understood as a set of relationships with respect to housing and land, established through statutory or customary law or informal or hybrid arrangements, that enables one to live in one's home with security, peace and dignity (A/HRC/25/54). Regardless of the type of tenure, all persons with security of tenure have a legal status against arbitrary unlawful eviction, harassment and other threats. People have secure tenure when: there is evidence of documentation that can be used as proof of secure tenure status; and, there is either de facto or perceived protection from forced evictions. Important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into the computation of the people living in slums.Informal Settlements b. Informal Settlements – Informal settlements are usually seen as synonymous of slums, with a particular focus on the formal status of land, structure and services. They are defined by three main criteria, according to Habitat III Issue Paper #22, which are already covered in the definition of slums. These are: Inhabitants have no security of tenure vis-à-vis the land or dwellings they inhabit, with modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental housing, The neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, formal basic services and city infrastructure, and The housing may not comply with current planning and building regulations, is often situated in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas, and may lack a municipal permit. Informal settlements can be occupied by all income levels of urban residents, affluent and poor.   Inadequate Housingc. Inadequate Housing – Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes housing as one of the components of the right to adequate standards of living for all. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights' general comments No.4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing and No.7 (1997) on forced evictions have underlined that the right to adequate housing should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. For housing to be adequate, it must provide more than four walls and a roof, and at a minimum, meet the following criteria: Legal security of tenure, which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats; Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, including safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage or refuse disposal; Affordability, as housing is not adequate if its cost threatens or compromises the occupants' enjoyment of other human rights; Habitability, as housing is not adequate if it does not guarantee physical safety or provide adequate space, as well as protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind, other threats to health and structural hazards; Accessibility, as housing is not adequate if the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups are not taken into account (such as the poor, people facing discrimination; persons with disabilities, victims of natural disasters); Location, as housing is not adequate if it is cut off from employment opportunities, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, or if located in dangerous or polluted sites or in immediate proximity to pollution sources; andCultural adequacy, as housing is not adequate if it does not respect and take into account the expression of cultural identity and ways of life.Comments and limitations:As with all indicators, there are a number of potential challenges and limitations. Some of these are outlined below.Difficulties to agree universally on some definitions and characteristics when referring to deteriorated housing conditions, often due to political or economic considerations.Lack of appropriate tools at national and city levels to measure all components required by Indicator 11.1.1, sometimes resulting in the underestimation of deteriorated housing units.The complicated relation between security of tenure with land and property makes it a difficult, but vital, aspect to include in the different surveys, and thus, to measure and monitor. Indicator 11.1.1 does not capture homelessness.Many countries still have limited capacities for data collection, management and analysis, their update and monitoring. These are key to ensure national and global data consistency.MethodologyComputation Method:The indicator considers two components to be computed as follows:Slum/Informal Settlements households (SISH): 		   Inadequate housing households (IHH):The unit of measurements for all these indicators will be %. Currently, the data for this indicator is already being reported in nearly all developing countries on what refers to slums and informal settlements, and in some countries for what refers to expenditure on housing. The SDG indicator 11.1.1 will therefore contribute to report on a broader spectrum of inadequate housing conditions affecting households in all countries."
"Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","Target 11.2: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons","Indicator 11.2.1: Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","This indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport. The access to public transport is considered convenient when an officially recognized stop is accessible within a distance of 0.5 km from a reference point such as a home, school, work place, market, etc. Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include:a. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations.b. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel timesc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environmentMethod of ComputationThis indicator is computed based on the following criteria:The identification of service areas is typically achieved using the buffering operation (using GIS) by constructing lines of equal proximity around each public transport stop or each public transport route. The buffering operation clearly involves at least two decisions. The first decision is whether routes or stops should be used as the reference of measurement. The two approaches may lead to very different values of spatial availability. But generally, public transport stops offer a more appropriate basis than routes for estimating service area coverage because stops are the actual locations where public transport users access the system. The other decision involved in the buffering operation is the buffer size. A common practice in public transport planning is to assume that people are served by public transport if they are within 0.5km (or 500m) of either a public transport route or stop. Once a distance threshold is defined, buffers are created around the public transport features. Some studies measure the distance based on air, or Euclidean, distance, while others use network distance (that is, the walk distance computed using the street network to reach a public transport feature. Since the network distance between two locations in space is greater than, or equal to, the corresponding air distance, the size of a coverage area defined by the network distance will be smaller than, or equal to, that defined by air distance. Network distance measures are likely to be more realistic because they reflect the configuration of the street network and recognize the presence of any man-made barriers preventing direct access to public transport features. In addition to using the above mentioned distance measures, others have suggested the use of travel time to public transport features as a measure of proximity. Using travel time is preferable to distance as a measure of proximity because travel time measures account for such pedestrian-unfriendly factors such as steep terrains. However, because of the additional data requirements and the amount of processing effort involved, travel time measures are rarely used in practice. For this indicator  the public transport stop will be used as the point of service.The identification of the population servedOnce a service buffer is constructed, the next step is to overlay the buffer onto other polygons, such as census tracts, for which socio-demographic data (such as population figures, disabled persons, type of residence area, etc. is available. These polygons are referred to as the analysis zones. Typically, a service buffer (denoted as i) intersects, either fully or partially, with more than one analysis zone j ( j=1…..J). The population served by the public transport service in buffer i, Pi, is thus equal to the sum of the population in each of the intersecting areas, Pij . HencePi=?_(j=1)^J¦PijWhere, Pij is estimated based on the amount of interaction between service buffer i and analysis zone j.In estimating Pij it is assumed that the population is uniformly distributed within the analysis zones.Integrating local temporal availability.The methodology described above covers public transport service solely based on spatial access to stops or routes and does not address the temporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. We note that temporal aspect of public transport availability is important because a service within walking distance is not necessarily considered as available if waiting times go beyond a certain threshold level that is required. This wait time for public transport is related to the frequency of the service as well as the threshold for tolerable waits for potential public transport users. We will leave out completely the temporal measurement for global comparison, but countries that can additionally capture this component are encouraged to collect and report this information as part of the disaggregation.Finally, the population with access to public transport out of the entire city population will be computed as; Percentage with access to Public transport =100x (population with convenient access to Public transport)/(City Population)"
"Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","Target 11.3: By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries",Indicator 11.3.1: Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate,"The indicator is defined as the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate.This indicator requires defining the two components of population growth and land consumption rate. Computing the population growth rate is more straightforward and more readily available, while land consumption rate is slightly challenging, and requires the use of new techniques. In estimating the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes  consumption  of land since this may cover aspects of  consumed  or  preserved  or available for  development  for cases such as land occupied by wetlands. Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being developed is truly  newly-developed  (or vacant) land, or if it is at least partially  redeveloped . As a result, the percentage of current total urban land that was newly developed (consumed) will be used as a measure of the land consumption rate. The fully developed area is also sometimes referred to as built up area.The formula to estimate the land use efficiency will be provided with two stages.Stage 1: Estimate the population growth rate. Population Growth rate i.e. PGR=LN(Popt_(t+n)/?Popt_t )/((y))Where Popt Total population within the city in the past/initial yearPopt+n Total population within the city in the current/final yeary The number of years between the two measurement periodsStage 2: Estimating the land consumption rateThis rate gives us a measure of compactness which indicates a progressive spatial expansion of a city. Land consumption rate i.e LCR=LN(Urb_(t+n)/Urb_t )/((y))WhereUrb_t Total areal extent of the urban agglomeration in km2 for past/initial year Urb_(t+n) Total areal extent of the urban agglomeration in km2 for current year y The number of years between the two measurement periodsThe formula to estimate the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate (LCRPGR) is provided as follows:LCRPGR= (+ ( Land Consumption rate)/(Annual Population growth rate)¦)And the overall formula can be summarized as:LCRPGR=(((LN(Urb_(t+n)/Urb_t ))/y))/((LN(Pop_(t+n)/Pop_t )/y) ) The periods for both- urban expansion and population growth rates should be at comparable scale."
"Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","Target 11.3: By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries",Indicator 11.3.2: Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operates regularly and democratically,"Civil society organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international development. They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups.  Therefore local and national governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people's participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator.To measure existence of direct participation structures of civil society in urban planning and management at the city level, a scorecard approach will be used to evaluate the available structures for civil society participation in urban planning and management, as evaluated by five (5) local experts from government, academia, civil society and international organizations. The identifications and selection of these 5 local evaluators/experts will be guided by local urban observatories teams that are available in many cities. In the pilot exercises, these urban observatories as local custodians of urban data at the city level are able to coordinate the assessments, and check for consistencies and relevant local references that guide the decisions and scores of the evaluators.A questionnaire with a 4-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree) will be used to measure and test the existence of structures for civil society participation in urban governance and management. As experts, we agreed that these structures are examined through four core elements and these were assessed in the completed pilot exercises as follows:Are there structures for civil society participation in urban planning, including design and agreements, that are direct, regular and democratic?Are there structures for civil society participation in local urban budget decision-making, that are direct, regular and democratic?Are there structures for civil society evaluation and feedback on the performance of urban management, that are direct, regular and democratic?Do these structures promote the participation of women, young men and women, and/or other marginalized groups?The evaluators score each of the questions on the Likert Scale, as below: 1 - Strongly disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - Agree, 4 - Strongly agreeThe Likert Scale use the following guidance for grading: Strongly Disagree: There are no structures in place or available structures do not allow civil society participation that is direct, regular or democratic.Disagree: Structures exist that allow civil society participation, but they are only partially direct, regular and democratic; or they are only one of direct, regular or democratic.Agree: Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society participation that is direct and/or regular and/or democratic, but not all three. Strongly Agree: Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society participation that is fully direct, regular and democratic.Once each of the five (5) categories is evaluated as shown in the table above by a single evaluator, the total average score of the single evaluator is computed. The various scores of the evaluators are then averaged to compute the final score for every city.To determine the proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operates regularly and democratically, a midpoint on the Likert scale of 2.5 will be used. The value of the indicator is the proportion of cities with overall score that is greater than the mid-point. As a result, if we have N cities selected for the evaluation in a given country, and n is the number of cities with scores that are higher than the mid-point, the value of the indicator will be calculated as: (to be expressed in percentage)To note, the number of cities in which the evaluation will be conducted may be determined using the National Sample of Cities approach. The approach will help draw a sample of cities using sound statistical and scientific methodologies based on several relevant city-specific criteria/characteristics that capture the specific contexts of countries, ensuring that the sample is representative of a given country's territory, geography, size, history, etc."

"Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management","Indicator 11.6.1: Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities","Proportion of municipal solid waste regularly collected and with adequate treatment and disposal out of total municipal solid waste generated. The goal of this indicator aims to generate the proportion of municipal solid waste regularly collected and that is adequately treated and disposed out of all the total municipal waste generated by the city. The numerator of this indicator is 'municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate final treatment and disposal' and the denominator is 'total municipal solid waste generated by the city'. Multiplication of the municipal solid waste generation per capita and population of the city can estimate total municipal solid waste generated by the city. When the municipal solid waste generation per capita is not available, household survey for a daily waste generation in household and other premises (e.g. restaurants, hotels, hospitals, schools, etc.) should be conducted. Since the waste generation can differ according to the seasons, the survey should be conducted at least two times a year to estimate the municipal solid waste generation per capita.Municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate final treatment and disposal is estimated through qualitative judgement of the degree of environmental control of facilities where the city's municipal waste is collected and transported. The judgement of environmental control can be conducted in line with the criteria below. Another important thing is to deduct residue amount from treatment facilities to avoid double count.All the treatment and disposal facilities that receive municipal solid waste of the city are checked against the criteria above and scored. Facilities that are scored above 10 for all the criteria are accounted as facilities that can deliver 'adequate treatment and disposal'.  Therefore, the amount of municipal solid waste received by the facilities that has capacity of delivering 'adequate treatment and disposal' is accounted as the amount of Municipal solid waste regularly collected with adequate final treatment and disposal."

"Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","Target 11.7: By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities ","Indicator 11.7.1: Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities ","Indicator 11.7.1 has several interesting concepts that required global consultations and consensus. These include; built-up area, cities, open spaces for public use, etc. As a custodian agency, UN-Habitat has worked on these concepts along with several other partners.City: A range of accepted definitions of the  city  exist, from those based on population data and extent of the built-up area to those that are based solely on administrative boundaries. These definitions vary within and between nations, complicating the task of international reporting for the SDGs. As partners, UN-Habitat organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting process. The global consultations narrowed down to two city definitions, both emanating from joint work conducted by teams from New York University and European Commission-Joint Research Centre. These are available elsewhere with full documentation of the pros and cons for each. For this indicator, partners resolved to work with the City as defined by its Urban extent (built-up and urbanized open space).City as defined by its Urban extent (built-up and urbanized open space) The definition of urban extent described in this note was developed to facilitate the study of a global sample of 200 cities in the production of the Atlas of Urban Expansion: 2016 Edition. It relies on the analysis of satellite imagery to define the boundary of the city morphologically – based on the density of structures, not on the density of population, which we know to be highly variable in different contexts. It supposes that non-residential zones should be thought of as part of the city, along with open spaces such as parks and small amounts of undeveloped land, in addition to residential areas that report populations for the census.Urban extent is defined as the total area occupied by the built-up area and the urbanized open space. The built-up area is defined as the contiguous area occupied by buildings and other impervious surfaces. Landsat imagery is used to identify and classify the built-up pixels into 3 types depending on the share of built-up density (urban-ness) in a 1-km2 circle of a given building (walking distance radius of about 564 meters around a given building):Urban built-up area: pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density greater than 50%. Suburban built-up area: pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density between 25%-50%. It also includes subdivided land, whether it is wholly unbuilt or not.Rural built-up area: pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density of less than 25% and that are not on subdivided land.The urbanized open space (mainly refers to unbuilt areas including open countryside, forests, crop fields, parks, unbuilt urban areas, cleared land) is classified into 3 types:Fringe open space consists of all open space pixels within 100 meters of urban or suburban pixels;Captured open space consists of all open space clusters that are fully surrounded by urban and suburban built-up pixels and the fringe open space pixels around them, and that are less than 200 hectares in area; andRural open space consists of all open spaces that are not fringe or captured open spaces.The fringe open space and captured open space together make up the urbanized open space in a given study area. In other words, the urban extent consists of all the buildings and the small open space areas (<200 ha) that are surrounded by buildings and the open space fringe that is within 100 meters of urban and suburban areas (i.e. where built up area is more than 25%).Public space: The Global Public Space toolkit defines Public Space as all places that are publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all, free and without a profit motive, categorized into streets, open spaces and public facilities. For the purpose of monitoring and reporting on indicator 11.7.1, public space is defined as all places of public use, accessible by all, and comprises open public space and streets. Public space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship. For measurement of indicator 11.7.1, the elements which can be considered as open public space include: Parks: Open space inside an urban territory that provide free air recreation and contact with nature. Their principal characteristic is the significant proportion of green area.Recreational areas: public areas that contribute to environmental preservation. Their main functions can be both ornamental and passive recreation.  These include areas such as playgrounds, riverfronts, waterfronts, public beaches, etc. Civic parks: Open space created because of building agglomeration around an open area, which was later transformed into a representative civic area. They are characterized by considerable nature, specifically gardens and a good place for cultural events and passive recreation.Squares and Plazas: Open spaces created because of building agglomeration around an open area. Its main characteristics are the significant architectonic elements and interaction between buildings and the open area. Squares are usually public spaces relevant to the city due to their location, territorial development, or cultural importance.Streets are defined thoroughfares that are based inside towns, cities and neighbourhoods most commonly lined with houses or buildings used by pedestrians or vehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city, interact and to earn a livelihood. The main purpose of a street is facilitating movement and enabling public interaction. The following elements are considered as streets space: Streets, avenues and boulevards, pavements, passages and galleries, Bicycle paths, sidewalks, traffic island, tramways and roundabouts. Elements excluded from street space include plots (either built-up), open space blocks, railways, paved space within parking lots and airports and individual industries.Land allocated to streets: refers to the total area of urban surface that is occupied by all forms of streets (as defined above). This indicator only includes streets available at the time of data collection and excludes proposed networks.The method to estimate the area of public space has been globally piloted in over 250 cities and this follows a series of methodological developments that go back to the last 7 years. The finalized methodology is a three-step process: Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area of the city; Spatial analysis to identify potential open public spaces, field work to validate data and access the quality of spaces and calculation of the total area occupied by the verified open public spaces; Estimation of the total area allocated to streets;Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area Built-up areas are a true reflection of multiple (urban) activities, and the presence of populations; with higher built-up density often reflecting higher activity/population concentrations. To monitor and report on indicator 11.7.1, the main focus is on the built-up area defined as the contiguous area occupied by buildings and other impervious surfaces. To delimit the area of analysis for the indicator, follow these steps:Identify the study area – this can be all cities in a country or a representative sample of cities  Download freely available LANDSAT imagery for the analysis year. Aim for imagery with low cloud cover. Alternative high resolution imagery from other sources can also be used.Classify LANDSAT imagery into built-up, non-built-up, and water using a GIS or image processing software.Assess the level of urban-ness for each of the resultant built-up pixels - This can be achieved through spatial statistics in GIS and/or image processing software. Place a 1-km2 circle around each built-up pixel and calculate the share of pixels in the circle that are also built-up. If >=50% of the pixels in the circle are built-up, the pixel is classified as Urban. If >=25% and <50% of the pixels in the circle are built-up, the pixel is classified as Suburban. If <25% of the pixels in the circle are built-up, the pixel is classified as Rural. Combine contiguous urban and suburban pixels to form an urban cluster of the built-up area.Spatial analysis to identify potential open public spaces, ground verification and estimate their total areaThis step involves mapping of potential open public spaces within the urban boundaries defined in step one above and estimation of their area. Identification of potential open public spaces is based on the spatial character of each space, and is also informed by existing country/ city land use maps and open space inventories. To compute this component of the indicator, follow these steps:An inventory of Open Public Spaces should be the initial source of information. Additional legal documents, land use plans and other official sources of information can be used to complement the data from the inventory.Since many cities and countries do not have an open public spaces inventory, satellite imagery can be used to identify potential open public spaces. The identification of such spaces from imagery should be based on careful evaluation of the character of each space against the known forms of open public spaces within that city / countryDigitize the identified potential open public spaces.Undertake field work to verify the identified spaces and assess their quality. UN-Habitat, in consultation with partners, experts and data producers have developed a detailed tool to facilitate the verification of each space and collection of additional data on the space quality and accessibility. This tool is freely available and allows for on-site definition/ editing of the space's boundaries. It also contains standard and extended questions which collect data relevant to the indicator, including location of the spaces, their ownership and management, safety, inclusivity and accessibility. This data provides basic information about each space, as well as information relevant for disaggregation - such as access issues linked to age, gender and disabilities, as requested for by the indicator. The tool is dynamic and allows cities to include extra questions which generate information that is useful for their decision making (Tool is available at https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/#IGFf6ubq). Calculate the total area covered by the verified open public spaces.Computation of land allocated to streets (LAS) Where street data by width and length fields is available/specified, the following methodology could be used:Select only the streets included in the urban extent (or clip streets to the working city boundary)From GIS (or alternative software), calculate the total area occupied by  each street by multiplying its length with width. Add up all individual street areas to attain the total amount of land occupied all streets within the defined urban area.An alternative technique for computing land allocated to the streets is one that adopts sampling principles.  An approach that uses the Halton sampling sequence is recommended, specifically because the sequence generates equidistant points, increasing the degree of sample representativeness. To compute LAS using this method, follow the following steps:   Using the urban extent boundary identified earlier, generate a Halton sequence of sample points (Halton sequence refers to quasi-random sequence used to generate points in space that are ex-post evenly spread i.e. Equidistant). The number of points used for each city varies based on its area.  In large study areas of more than 20 km2, a density of one circle per hectare is used while in small study areas of less than 20 km2 a density of 0.5 circle per hectare is used.Buffer the points to get sample areas with an area of 10 hectares each. Within each 10 hectare sample area, digitize all streets in GIS software and compute the total amount of land they occupy.  Calculate the average land allocated to streets for all sample areas using the following formula:The land allocated to streets = The final computation of the indicator is done using the formula:"

One of the targets is:  Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020 .In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG ). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators.Member States count the number of local governments that adopt and implement local DRR strategies in line with the national strategy and express it as a percentage of the total number of local governments in the country.Local governments are determined by the reporting country for this indicator, considering sub-national public administrations with responsibility to develop local disaster risk reduction strategies. It is recommended that countries report on progress made by the lowest level of government accorded the mandate for disaster risk reduction, as the Sendai Framework promotes the adoption and implementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies in every local authority.Each Member State will calculate the ratio of the number of local governments with local DRR strategies in line with national strategies and the total number of local governments.Global Average will then be calculated as below through arithmetic average of the data from each Member State.

Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Target 12.c: Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities",Indicator 12.c.1: Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption) and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels,"In order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional and global level, three sub-indicators are recommended for reporting on this indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers (price support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and under-pricing of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Office's Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is proposed to drop the wording  as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels  and thus this indicator is effectively ""Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)"". It is proposed that countries report on the subsidy categories listed below as sub-indicators.-	Direct transfers; -	Induced transfers (reporting on regulated prices and calculation of the total amount);-	Tax expenditure, other government revenue foregone and under-pricing of goods and services, including risk (optional). The last category should be included as an optional sub-indicator. Each sub-indicator should be expressed in national currency or United States dollars in current prices. UN Environment will use market exchange rates to calculate between national currency and United States dollar. Care should be given if a country chooses to aggregate across the three sub-indicators in order to avoid double counting and all three sub-indicators should be publicly available to ensure transparency.  Care needs to be taken when aggregating estimates of induced transfers with data on direct transfers and some measures in under-pricing of goods and services. Estimates of subsidies to consumers observable through price-gaps (i.e., consumer price support) have been calculated by several international organizations (IADB, IEA, and IMF), covering different geographic regions and time-periods. The three organisations that produce these estimates use roughly the same approach, which can be summed up by the following equation:Consumer price support = (adjusted net-of-tax reference unit price – local net-of-tax unit price) x units subsidizedEstimates are based on reference prices on import (or export) parity prices using the price of a product at the nearest international hub, adjusted for quality differences if necessary, plus (or minus) the cost of freight and insurance to the net importer (or back to the net exporter), plus the cost of internal distribution and marketing and any value-added tax (VAT). For tradable commodities (mainly coal, crude oil, and petroleum products), the reference prices are based on the spot price at the nearest international hub – e.g., the United States, Northwest Europe, or Singapore."

Sustainable Consumption and Production: the working definition of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) used in the context of this framework is:  The use of services and related products, which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimising the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generation.  Policy: although quite flexible and contexts specific, a policy is usually defined as a course of action that has been officially agreed by an entity or an organization (governmental or non-governmental) and is effectively implemented to achieve specific objectives.Policy instruments for sustainable consumption and production: policy instruments refer to the means – methodologies, measures or interventions – that are used to achieve those objectives. In the case of SCP, such instruments are designed and implemented to reduce the environmental impacts of consumption and production patterns, with a view of generating economic and/or social benefits. Making progress along the policy cycle refers to the development, adoption, implementation or evaluation of such policy instruments.  To be reported under this indicator, a government should have moved through one or more new stage(s) of the  Policy cycle  on one or more policy instrument(s) during the reporting period.This indicator is calculated at relevant aggregation levels based on the information collected from the National Focal Points and other government officials; users of the data should be mindful of double counting one same policy, when aggregating data across reporting years."

Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries,Indicator 13.1.3: Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies,"The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is:  Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020 .In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG ). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators.Member States count the number of local governments that adopt and implement local DRR strategies in line with the national strategy and express it as a percentage of the total number of local governments in the country.Local governments are determined by the reporting country for this indicator, considering sub-national public administrations with responsibility to develop local disaster risk reduction strategies. It is recommended that countries report on progress made by the lowest level of government accorded the mandate for disaster risk reduction, as the Sendai Framework promotes the adoption and implementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies in every local authority.Each Member State will calculate the ratio of the number of local governments with local DRR strategies in line with national strategies and the total number of local governments.Global Average will then be calculated as below through arithmetic average of the data from each Member State. Further information of the methodology can be obtained in the Technical Guidance (see reference)."
"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","Target 14.3: Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels",Indicator 14.3.1: Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations,"Ocean acidification is the reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period, typically of decades or longer, which is caused primarily by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This indicator is based on observations that constrain the ocean carbon system and which are required to describe the variability of ocean acidity. The carbon system in this context mainly refers to the four measureable parameters: pH (the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale), DIC (CT; total dissolved inorganic carbon), pCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure), and TA (AT, total alkalinity). Average, as used here, is the equally weighed annual mean. A agreed suite of representative sampling stations are sites that have a measurement frequency that is adequate for describing variability and trends in carbonate chemistry in order to deliver critical information on the exposure of and impacts on marine systems to ocean acidification, and which provide data of sufficient quality and with comprehensive metadata information to enable integration with data from other sites in the country. This indicator calls for the collection of multiple observations, in the form of individual data points, to capture the variability in ocean acidity. Individual data points for pH either are measured directly or can be calculated based on data for two of the other carbonate chemistry parameters, these being TA (AT), DIC (CT) and pCO2.  Calculation tools developed by experts in the field are freely available, and they are introduced and linked in the methodology. Average pH is defined as the annual equally weighed mean of multiple data points at representative sampling stations. The exact number of samples and data points depends on the level of variability of ocean acidity at the site in question. The minimum number of samples should enable the characterisation of a seasonal cycle at the site. Detailed guidelines on the minimum number of observations required are provided in the Methodology. In addition to the data value, standard deviation and the total range (minimum and maximum values measured), as well as underlying data used to provide traceability and transparency (metadata information) should be reported. If historical data is available, this should be released to enable calculations about the rate of change and to compare natural variability and anthropogenic effects. "
"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","Target 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics",Indicator 14.4.1: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels,"The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.Fishery sustainability is defined based on stock abundance. To know stock abundance, one needs to carry out stock assessment that uses fish catch statistics, fishing effort data and biological information and fit the data to a population dynamics model. After completing stock assessment for all stocks concerned, fish stocks that have abundance at or above the level associated with the maximum sustainable yield are counted as biologically sustainable, and otherwise are considered as overfished."
"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","Target 14.5: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information",Indicator 14.5.1: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas,"The indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for marine biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas.This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2017) and digital polygons for marine Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the ). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.Year of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. In 2017 we slightly changed the methods described by Butchart et al. (2012, 2015) by randomly assigning a year to protected areas with no year of establishment before calculating trends in coverage. This is a computationally more efficient method and is likely to reflect more accurately changes in protected area coverage over time. Previously the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered."
"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","Target 14.6: By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation","Indicator 14.6.1: Progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing","Progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.The indicator is based upon responses by States to a certain sections of the questionnaire for monitoring the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and related instruments (CCRF). These are sections covering the implementation of different international instruments used to combat IUU fishing. The responses will be converted using an algorithm to obtain a score for the indicator. Each instrument will be covered within a given variable, as follows:Variable 1 (V1) - Adherence and implementation of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the SeaVariable 2 (V2) - Adherence and implementation of the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement Variable 3 (V3) - Development and implementation of a national plan of action (NPOA) to combat IUU fishing in line with the IPOA-IUU Variable 4 (V4) - Adherence and implementation of the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA) Variable 5 (V5) - Implementation of Flag State Responsibilities in the context of the 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement and FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State PerformanceDepending on responses by FAO Members on the adherence and implementation of the above-mentioned instruments, States will score an indicator value between 0 and 1. Each variable is given a weighting, which takes into consideration the importance of the instrument in combating IUU fishing as well as the overlap between the instruments. The variable weightings are as follows:(*) item on  Applicability of instruments For binding agreements, States will still be able to score points if they are not party to the agreement but are implementing its provisions. States will also score points if they have initiated the process to becoming party to an agreement. This indicator is automatically computed within the web-application on which the countries will be responding to the questionnaire. Once the questionnaire is completed the respondent will be presented with a report of the indicator, describing the methodology and the score attained. The user will then be able to give a final confirmation of the indicator. The final scores from all the respondents will automatically be collected onto a database. This web-application will also allow the user to access in any the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Russian.Choice of weighting per variable:The weightings for each variable have been carefully selected. These have been determined based upon their importance of their role in combatting IUU fishing as well as in consideration of the overlap present in between the different instruments. It is also for this consideration of overlap that the VG-FSP and the Compliance Agreement have been combined into Variable 5.Applicability of instruments:A set of questions will be present to determine certain characteristics of States (coastal, port, flag and land-locked). This will ensure that the indicator scoring for a country is not negatively affected if an instrument is not applicable to them. In such case, the weighing of the variable that is not applicable is redistributed into the remaining variables. In cases where none of the instruments is applicable, the country will get an indicator score of  N/A .For more details regarding the list of question, scoring and applicability, please refer to Appendix 1 and 2."
"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","Target 14.7: By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island Developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism","Indicator 14.7.1: Sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries","This indicator expresses the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). At a country level, the contribution of sustainable marine capture fisheries to the GDP is calculated as follows:The percentage contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to GDP is estimated by simply dividing the value added of fisheries and aquaculture by national GDP.In order to disaggregate for the value added of marine capture fisheries and the value added of aquaculture, the quantity of fish produced from marine capture fisheries will be divided by total quantity of national production of fish, and then multiplied by the percentage of GDP from fisheries and aquaculture. As such, the quantity of production of marine capture fisheries is used as a proxy for the value of marine capture fisheries.The sustainability multiplier will be calculated based on the average sustainability published periodically for each FAO major marine fishing area.For each country, the sustainability multiplier will be the average sustainability weighted by the proportion of the quantity of marine capture for each respective fishing area in which the country performs fishing activities. When a country fishes in only one FAO fishing area, its sustainability multiplier will be equal to the average sustainability of stocks in that area.The value added of marine capture fisheries (b) will be adjusted by the sustainability multiplier (c) to get the sustainable marine capture fisheries as a percentage of GDPIn summary, the computation method for GDP from sustainable marine capture fisheries may also be expressed as:"
"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","Target 14.a: Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries",Indicator 14.a.1: Proportion of total research budget allocated to research in the field of marine technology.,"Definitions and mechanisms used in the development of the SDG indicator 14.a.1 are based on the IOC Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology- IOCCGTMT (originally published and endorsed by IOC Member States in 2005, these guidelines provide an internationally agreed definition of what is understood by the term marine technology. These Guidelines have been referenced in various UN General Assembly Resolutions and specifically in the formulation of SDG target 14.a). These are further explained in the Global Ocean Science Report (GOSR) referenced below.Marine technology as defined in the IOCCGTMT refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. Toward this end, marine technology may include any of the following components:Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services;Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials;Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples);Observation facilities and equipment (e.g. remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation);Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation;Computer and computer software, including models and modelling techniques;Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation.Indicator 14.a.1 shows the annual national research budget allocated by governments in the field of marine technology, relative to the overall national governmental research and development budget in general.Unit: percentage; raw data in national currency. The proportion can be calculated, and if needed, data can be converted by the international agency into USD.Indicator 14.a.1 = National governmental research expenditure in marine technology / National governmental R&D expenditureNational governmental R&D expenditure data are assessed annually by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).National governmental ocean science expenditures are envisaged to be assessed biannually via the GOSR data portal (IOC-XXIX/2 Annex 10).The development of the GOSR data repository/data portal will take place in close collaboration with UIS and IOC (at Headquarters and at the IOC Project Office for IODE, Oostende, Belgium)."
"Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development",Target 14.b: Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets,Indicator 14.b.1: Progress by countries in the degree of application of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries,"Progress by number of countries in the degree of application of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries.The indicator is calculated using three variables, which are given respective weightings for the final calculation. There has not been a change in the calculation, nor the use of mixed sources. Variable 1: Existence of laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies that specifically target or address the small-scale fisheries sectorVariable 2: Ongoing specific initiatives to implement the SSF GuidelinesVariable 3: Existence of mechanisms enabling small-scale fishers and fish workers to contribute to decision-making processes Performance is scored based on the country responses to the relevant portions of three questions included in the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries Questionnaire (CCRF). These questions have been transformed into weighted variables for the purpose of calculating the country scores. The target has been set at a positive ('yes') response to all the sub-variables, resulting in a score of 1.  The higher weighting assigned to Variable 1 reflects the slightly greater importance of that indicator for assessing the degree of application of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fishers.  Each sub-variable is scored on the basis of a 'yes' or 'no' response and any 'blank' or 'unknown' responses are scored as a 'no', or zero. A response of yes results in a score that corresponds with the full weighting value for that variable category. For example, a 'yes' response for variables 1.3, 2.1 and 3.1 are scored as 0.1, 0.03 and 0.3 respectively.One exception is made in the case of sub-variable 1.5. This question allows a response of 'other' with an associated text field. A positive response in this field is only scored as a 'yes' in the case where the text field is also completed AND at least one of the other prior sub-variable were scored as 'no'. This allows the indicator weighting to remain consistent in all cases.Once the specific score has been determined for each country, countries will be classified into a number of bands, ranging from a low to a high degree of implementation, and thus effectively translate a synthetic score into a tangible and intuitive metric for countries.

"Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss","Target 15.2: By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally",Indicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management ," Sustainable forest management  (SFM) is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations  (Resolution A/RES/62/98) The indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. The sub-indicators are: Forest area annual net change rate Above-ground biomass stock in forest Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme A dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators. The adoption of the dashboard approach aims at ensuring consideration of all dimensions of sustainable forest management and provides for clear view of areas where progress has been achieved. Comments and limitations: The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized under the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. Furthermore, as the trends are calculated using only those countries which have data complete time series, different sub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries. While the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators. Methodology Computation Method: National data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected areas, and forest area under management plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on the country reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net change rate using the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest area within protected area and under management plan is calculated using the reported areas and the official FAOSTAT land area for reference year 2015. Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme are reported to FAO by the head offices of respective forest certification scheme, who are jointly adjusting the figures to remove any double accounting. No dashboard traffic lights are made at country level. FORESTLand spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.

Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.Includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.Excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the  Taungya  system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASSAll living biomass above the soil including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds, and foliage.Explanatory note In cases where forest understorey is a relatively small component of the aboveground biomass carbon pool, it is acceptable to exclude it, provided this is done in a consistent manner throughout the inventory time series.PROTECTED AREASAreas especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means.FOREST AREA WITHIN PROTECTED AREASForest area within formally established protected areas independently of the purpose for which the protected areas were established.

Explanatory notesA forest area with management plan may refer to forest management unit level or aggregated forest management unit level (forest blocks, farms, enterprises, watersheds, municipalities, or wider units).A management plan must include adequate detail on operations planned for individual operational units (stands or compartments) but may also provide general strategies and activities planned to reach management goals.Includes forest area in protected areas with management plan.INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED FOREST MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATIONForest area certified under a forest management certification scheme with published standards and is independently verified by a third-party.
Annex 2 – MethodologySub-indicator 1 - Forest area annual net change rateUnit: PercentReference period: Most recent periodMethod of estimation: Compound interest formulaTranslation to dashboard/traffic light:The following flowchart explains the logic behind the translation of this indicator to a dashboard/traffic light:The forest area change direction is determined by examining the value of the forest area change rate for the most recent period, a negative value indicate a loss of forest area, a zero value means that forest area is stable and a positive value means that forest area has increased. The change in forest area loss rate is based on a comparison of the current forest area net change rate with the baseline forest area net change rate for the period 2010-2015.Comments:This traffic light takes into consideration both the direction of forest area change (if forest area increases or decreases) as well as changes in the rate of forest area loss – the latter important in order to indicate progress among countries that are losing forest area but manage to reduce the loss rate. For annual reporting, FAO can provide countries with imputed values based on previous trends that they can use in case they don't have new/updated information. The baseline should be updated every 5 years, so in 2020 a new baseline is calculated. Also, at country level, if a country gets new information and updates the historical time series, the baseline for the country will be recalculated, respecting the 2010-2015 period.Sub-indicator 2 – Above-ground biomass stock in forest Unit: tonnes/hectareReference year: Latest reporting yearMethod of estimation: Biomass stock in forest (tonnes) / forest area (ha)Translation to dashboard/traffic light:The indicator value for the latest reporting year is compared with the indicator value for previous reporting year for assessment of continuity of progress since last report.The ratio (r) between the current indicator value and the previously reported value is calculated; r>1 means an increase in stock per hectare, r<1 means a decrease while 1 indicates no change.

A small interval for r has been established to indicate a stable condition, and traffic-light colors are assigned as follows:	r ≥ 1.01 		0.99 < r < 1.01	r ≤ 0.99
Comments:Using June 30 as the date for reporting, allows for the certification bodies to have their databases updated so they can provide information to FAO by end of the year, and then be included in the annual reporting to SDG in the beginning of the following year."

This definition was adopted by and is used by the 196 countries that are Party to the UNCCD. (see also Figure 1)Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is defined as a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems (decision 3/COP12).Total land area is the total surface area of a country excluding the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes.The measurement unit for this indicator is the spatial extent (hectares or km2) expressed as the proportion (percentage or %) of land that is degraded over total land area.SDG indicator 15.3.1 is a binary - degraded/not degraded - quantification based on the analysis of available data for three sub-indicators to be validated and reported by national authorities. The sub-indicators (Trends in Land Cover, Land Productivity and Carbon Stocks) were adopted by the UNCCD's governing body in 2013 as part of its monitoring and evaluation approach. The method of computation for this indicator follows the  One Out, All Out  statistical principle and is based on the baseline assessment and evaluation of change in the sub-indicators to determine the extent of land that is degraded over total land area.The One Out, All Out (1OAO) principle is applied taking into account changes in the sub-indicators which are depicted as (i) positive or improving, (ii) negative or declining, or (iii) stable or unchanging. If one of the sub-indicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) for a particular land unit, then it would be considered as degraded subject to validation by national authorities.By analysing changes in the sub-indicators in the context of local assessments of climate, soil, land use and any other factors influencing land conditions, national authorities can determine which land units are to be classified as degraded, sum the total, and report on the indicator. A conceptual framework, endorsed by the UNCCD's governing body in September 2017, underpins a universal methodology for deriving the indicator. The methodology helps countries to select the most appropriate datasets for the sub-indicators and determine national methods for estimating the indicator. In order to assist countries with monitoring and reporting, Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1 has been developed by the UNCCD and its partners. The indicator is derived from a binary classification of land condition (i.e., degraded or not degraded) based primarily, and to the largest extent possible, on comparable and standardized national official data sources. However, due to the nature of the indicator, Earth observation and geospatial information from regional and global data sources can play an important role in its derivation, subject to validation by national authorities. Quantifying the indicator is based on the evaluation of changes in the sub-indicators in order to determine the extent of land that is degraded over total land area. The sub-indicators are few in number, complementary and non-additive components of land-based natural capital and sensitive to different degradation factors. As a result, the 1OAO principle is applied in the method of computation where changes in the sub-indicators are depicted as (i) positive or improving, (ii) negative or declining, or (iii) stable or unchanging. If one of the sub-indicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) for a particular land unit, then normally it would be considered as degraded subject to validation by national authorities. The baseline year for the indicator is 2015 and its value (t0) is derived from an initial quantification and assessment of time series data for the sub-indicators for each land unit during the period 2000-2015. Subsequent values for the indicator during each monitoring period (t1-n) are derived from the quantification and assessment of changes in the sub-indicators as to whether there are has been positive, negative or no change for each land unit relative to the baseline value. Although the indicator will be reported as a single figure quantifying the area of land that is degraded as a proportion of land area, it can be spatially disaggregated by land cover class or other policy‐relevant units.As detailed in the Good Practice Guidance for SDG indicator 15.3.1, deriving the indicator for the baseline and subsequent monitoring years is done by summing all those areas where any changes in the sub-indicators are considered negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) by national authorities. This involves the:(1) assessment and evaluation of land cover and land cover changes;
(2) analysis of land productivity status and trends based on net primary production; and 
(3) determination of carbon stock values and changes, with an initial assessment of soil organic carbon as the proxy.It is good practice to assess change for interim and final reporting years in relation to the baseline year for each sub-indicator and then the indicator. This facilitates the spatial aggregation of the results from the sub-indicators for each land unit to determine the proportion of land that is degraded for the baseline and each monitoring year. Furthermore, it ensures that land classified as degraded will retain that status unless it has improved relative to the baseline or previous monitoring year. Land degradation (or improvement) as compared to the baseline may be identified with reference to parameters describing the slope and confidence limits around the trends in the sub-indicators, or to the level or distribution of conditions in space and/or time as shown during the baseline period. The evaluation of changes in the sub-indicators may be determined using statistical significance tests or by interpretation of results in the context of local indicators, data and information. The method of computation for SDG indicator 15.3.1 is illustrated in Figure 2.Figure 2: Steps to derive the indicator from the sub-indicators, where ND is not degraded and D is degraded.

The area degraded in the monitoring period tn within land cover class i is estimated by summing all the area units within the land cover class determined to be degraded plus all area units that had previously been defined as degraded and that remain degraded:		(1)Where:  is the total area degraded in the land cover class i in the year of monitoring n (ha); is the area defined as degraded in the current monitoring year following 1OAO assessment of the sub-indicators (ha); is the area previously defined as degraded which remains degraded in the monitoring year following the 1OAO assessment of the sub-indicators (ha).The proportion of land cover type i that is degraded is then given by:		(2)Whereis the proportion of degraded land in that land cover type i in the monitoring period n;   is the total area degraded in the land cover type i in the year of monitoring n (ha); is the total area of land cover type i within the national boundary (ha). The total area of land that is degraded over total land area is the accumulation across the m land cover classes within the monitoring period n is given by:		(3)Where is the total area degraded in the year of monitoring n (ha); is the total area degraded in the land cover type i in the year of monitoring n.The total proportion of land that is degraded over total land area is given by:		(4)Where is the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area; is the total area degraded in the year of monitoring n (ha); is the total area within the national boundary (ha).

"Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss","Target 15.4: By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development",Indicator 15.4.1: Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity,"This indicator Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for mountain biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas.This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2017), Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the ), and mountains (UNEP-WCMC 2002). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.Year of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. In 2017 we slightly changed the methods described by Butchart et al. (2012, 2015) by randomly assigning a year to protected areas with no year of establishment before calculating trends in coverage. This is a computationally more efficient method and is likely to reflect more accurately changes in protected area coverage over time.Previously the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered."

"Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss","Target 15.5: Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species",Indicator 15.5.1:  Red List Index,"The Red List Index measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1.The Red List Index is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for 'Near Threatened' to 5 for 'Extinct' and 'Extinct in the Wild') and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the 'Extinct' category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the Red List Index value.Mathematically this calculation is expressed as: RLIt = 1 – [(Ss Wc(t,s) / (WEX * N)]Where Wc(t,s) is the weight for category (c) at time (t) for species (s) (the weight for 'Critically Endangered' = 4, 'Endangered' = 3, 'Vulnerable' = 2, 'Near Threatened' = 1, 'Least Concern' = 0. 'Critically Endangered' species tagged as 'Possibly Extinct' or 'Possibly Extinct in the Wild' are assigned a weight of 5); WEX = 5, the weight assigned to 'Extinct' or 'Extinct in the Wild' species; and N is the total number of assessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current time period, and those considered to be 'Extinct' in the year the set of species was first assessed.The formula requires that:Exactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, andThe only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine improvement or deterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting from improved knowledge or taxonomic revisions), andData Deficient species are excluded.In many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the Red List Index until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, Red List Indices are typically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species worldwide have been assessed for the Red List, or for samples of species that have been systematically or randomly selected.The methods and scientific basis for the Red List Index were described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010). Butchart et al. (2010) also described the methods by which Red List Indices for different taxonomic groups are aggregated to produce a single multi-taxon Red List Index. Specifically, aggregated Red List Indices are calculated as the arithmetic mean of modelled Red List Indices. Red List Indices for each taxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between data points and extrapolated linearly (with a slope equal to that between the two closest assessed points) to align them with years for which Red List Indices for other taxa are available. The Red List Indices for each taxonomic group for each year are modelled to take into account various sources of uncertainty: Data Deficiency: Red List categories (from Least Concern to Extinct) are assigned to all Data Deficient species, with a probability proportional to the number of species in non-Data Deficient categories for that taxonomic group; Extrapolation uncertainty: although RLIs were extrapolated linearly based on the slope of the closest two assessed point, there is uncertainty about how accurate this slope may be. To incorporate this uncertainty, rather than extrapolating deterministically, the slope used for extrapolation is selected from a normal distribution with a probability equal to the slope of the closest two assessed points, and standard deviation equal to 60% of this slope (i.e., the CV is 60%); Temporal variability: the 'true' Red List Index likely changes from year to year, but because assessments are repeated only at multi-year intervals, the precise value for any particular year is uncertain. To make this uncertainty explicit, the Red List Index value for a given taxonomic group in a given year is assigned from a moving window of five years, centred on the focal year (with the window set as 3-4 years for the first two and last two years in the series). Note that assessment uncertainty cannot yet be incorporated into the index. Practically, these uncertainties are incorporated into the aggregated Red List Indices as follows: Data Deficient species were allotted a category as described above, and a Red List Index for each taxonomic group was calculated interpolating and extrapolating as described above. A final Red List Index value was assigned to each taxonomic group for each year from a window of years as described above. Each such 'run' produced a Red List Index for the complete time period for each taxonomic group, incorporating the various sources of uncertainty. Ten thousand such runs are generated for each taxonomic group, and the mean is calculated.Methods for generating national disaggregations of the Red List Index are described below."

It refers to the efforts by countries to implement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance.  The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.   The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by providing a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use.

The definition relates directly to  public access to information , which is wider than, but is also very much based upon, the established fundamental freedoms of expression and association. Conversely, these freedoms also both impact on the environment for public access to information. The method of computation is both quantitative and qualitative, with data generated from a global review of existing surveys (e.g. UNESCO's World Trends in Freedom of Expression & Media Development reports, etc.), administrative records, expert assessments (e.g. World Justice Open Government Index), etc. More specifically, the following key variables will be assessed: 1. Does a country have constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information?2. Do those constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees reflect known international agreements (e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.)?3. What implementation mechanisms are in place to ensure that such guarantees work optimally?To address these questions, the following will serve as performance sub-indicators:- National law or constitutional guarantee on the right to information- Country has signed and ratified relevant treaty obligations, with no significant exemptions, and these are reflected, to the extent possible, in domestic FOI legislation- Public is aware of and exercises right to access official information- Public bodies release information both pro-actively and on demand- Effective and efficient appeals mechanism via independent administrative body e.g. information commissioner or ombudsman- Any restriction on grounds of protection of personal privacy is narrowly defined so as to exclude information in which there is no justifiable public interest. The means of verification will include:- Any law or policy on right to information that accords with international standards- Reports from credible agencies/experts about right to information guarantees and the extent to which they reflect international standards/agreements- Policies of public bodies concerning release of information (which ensure readily, freely available public access to information, including online)- Evidence of state commitment to open government e.g. publication and dissemination of laws, court decisions, parliamentary proceedings, spending programmes (vis-à-vis SDG undertakings)- Statistical information about public requests for official information and their fulfilment or rejection- Statistical information about appeals or complaints over information requests that have been refused"

Sexual activities are also considered as abuse when committed against a child by another child if the offender is significantly older than the victim or uses power, threat or other means of pressure. Consensual sexual activities between children are not considered as sexual abuse if the children are older than the age limit defined by the State Party.Comments and limitations:The availability of comparable data remains a serious challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different study methodologies and designs, definitions of sexual violence, samples and questions to elicit information.

The coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and the time period covered is the last three completed fiscal years.The methodology for calculating this indicator is provided in a spreadsheet (titled  En PI-1 and PI-2 Exp Calculation-Feb 1 2016 (xls) ) on the PEFA website (http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016-framework). It is also detailed in part 2 of the document  Framework for assessing public financial management  (https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf).Scoring is at the heart of the indicator. A country is scored separately on a four-point ordinal scale: A, B, C, or D, according to precise criteria: (A) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 95% and 105% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.(B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 90% and 110% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.(C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 85% and 115% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.(D) Performance is less than required for a C score.In order to justify a particular score, every aspect specified in the scoring requirements must be fulfilled. If the requirements are only partly met, the criteria are not satisfied and a lower score should be given that coincides with achievement of all requirements for the lower performance rating. A score of C reflects the basic level of performance for each indicator and dimension, consistent with good international practices. A score of D means that the feature being measured is present at less than the basic level of performance or is absent altogether, or that there is insufficient information to score the dimension.The D score indicates performance that falls below the basic level. 'D' is applied if the performance observed is less than required for any higher score. For this reason, a D score is warranted when sufficient information is not available to establish the actual level of performance. A score of D due to insufficient information is distinguished from D scores for low-level performance by the use of an asterisk—that is, D* at the dimension level. The asterisk is not included at the indicator level.The coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and requires data for three consecutive years as a basis for assessment. The data would cover the most recent completed fiscal year for which data is available and the two immediately preceding years."

","This indicator measures levels of public satisfaction with people's last experience with public services, in the three service areas of healthcare, education and government services. This is a survey-based indicator which emphasizes citizens' experiences over general perceptions, with an eye on measuring the availability and quality of services as they were actually delivered to survey respondents. Respondents are asked to reflect on their last experience with each service, and to provide a rating on five 'attributes', or service-specific standards, of healthcare, education and government services (such as access, affordability, quality of facilities, etc.). A final question asks respondents for their overall satisfaction level with each service. While disaggregation dimensions are not specified by the indicator, it is recommended that survey results, at a minimum, be disaggregated by sex, income and place of residence (urban/rural, administrative regions). To the extent possible, all efforts should be made to also disaggregate results by disability status and by 'nationally relevant population groups'."
"Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels","Target 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels","Indicator 16.7.1: Proportions of positions (by age group, sex, persons with disabilities and population groups) in public institutions (national and local), including (a) the legislatures; (b) the public service; and (c) the judiciary, compared to national distributions. ","This metadata sheet is focused only on the first sub-component of indicator 16.7.1, namely on positions in national legislatures held by individuals of each target population (sex, age, persons with disabilities, and contextually relevant population groups). The legislative sub-component of indicator 16.7.1 aims to measure how representative of the general population are the individuals occupying key decision-making positions in national legislatures. More specifically, this indicator measures the proportional representation of various demographic groups (women, age groups) in the national population amongst individuals occupying the following positions in national legislatures: (1) Members, (2) Speakers and (3) Chairs of permanent committees in charge of the following portfolios: Foreign Affairs, Defence, Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality. Furthermore, it looks at the electoral and constitutional provisions adopted by countries to secure representation in national legislatures of persons with disabilities and contextually relevant population groups. Members:Indicator 16.7.1(a) aims to compare the proportion of various demographic groups (by sex and age) represented in national parliaments, relative to the proportion of these same groups in the national population above the age of eligibility. To report on indicator 16.7.1(a), two ratios must be calculated, namely: For 'young' MPs (aged 45 and below) For female MPs When comparing ratios of 'young' MPs and female MPs with corresponding shares of the national population that is aged 45 and below (for the first ratio) and female (for the second ratio), it is important to consider the population of, or above, the age of eligibility, the latter being, by definition, the lowest possible age of members of parliament. In other words, if the age of eligibility in a given country is 18 years old, the national population to be used as a comparator for the first ratio (for 'young' MPs) will be the national population aged 18-45 (not 0-45), and for the second ratio (for female MPs), the female population aged 18 and above. To calculate the ratio for 'young' MPs (aged 45 and below), the following formula is to be used: Ratio 1 =  Proportion of MPs aged 45 and below in parliament                     Proportion of the national population aged 45 and below(with the age of eligibility as a lower boundary)Where: The numerator is the number of seats held by MPs aged 45 and below, divided by the total number of members in parliamentThe denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows: [Size of national population < or = to 45] – [Size of national population < to age of eligibility]Size of the national populationThe resulting ratio can then be interpreted as follows:  0 means no representation at all of 'youth' (45 years and below) in parliament 1 means perfectly proportional representation of 'youth' (45 years and below) in parliament <1 means under-representation of 'youth' (45 years and below) in parliament >1 means over-representation of 'youth' (45 years and below) in parliament While a simple proportion of 'young' MPs in parliament is not internationally comparable, a ratio computed using the above formula is. For instance, 48% of 'young' MPs (45 years old or younger) may be an overrepresentation of youth in country A where only 30% of the national population above eligibility age falls in this age bracket (Ratio = 48/30 = 1.6), but in country B where 70% of the national population is 45 years old or younger, the same 48% would be interpreted as under-representation (Ratio = 48/70 = 0.69). In this example, the figure of 48% is not internationally comparable in relation to the national population (it means over-representation in one country and under-representation in another), but the ratios 1.6 and 0.69 are internationally comparable. They help us understand whether 48% of MPs aged 45 years old or less is close to, or far from, proportional representation of this age group in the national population. To calulate the ratio for female MPs, the following formula is to be used: Ratio 2 = 	 		 	Proportion of women in parliament			      Proportion of women in the national population (with the age of eligibility as a lower boundary)Where: The numerator is the number of seats held by female MPs, divided by the total number of members in parliamentThe denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows: [Size of female national population > or = to age of eligibility]Size of the national population > or = to age of eligibilityNote: This denominator can be set at 50 in most countries, as women generally represent around 50% of the national population in any given age bracket. The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of women at all in parliament<1, when the proportion of women in parliament is lower than that in the national population =1, when the proportion of women in parliament equals that in the national population>1, when the proportion of women in parliament is higher than that in the national populationSpeakers: No computation, as most parliaments will only have one Speaker per parliament in unicameral parliaments or one Speaker per chamber in bicameral parliaments. Personal characteristics of the individual(s) holding the position of Speaker are recorded (i.e. age group and sex).Chairs of permanent committees on Foreign Affairs, Defence, Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality: No computation, as data is collected only on five committee Chairs. Personal characteristics of the five individuals chairing these three committees are recorded (i.e. age group and sex). Computation in bicameral legislaturesIn bicameral parliaments, data will be collected and computed separately for the same set of positions in each chamber.  "
"Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels","Target 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels","Indicator 16.7.1: Proportions of positions (by age group, sex, persons with disabilities and population groups) in public institutions (national and local), including (a) the legislatures; (b) the public service; and (c) the judiciary, compared to national distributions. ","This metadata is focused only on the public service sub-component of indicator 16.7.1. It measures representation in the public service with respect to the sex, age, disability and population group status of public servants. It assesses the extent to which the proportion of female, or disabled, or indigenous public servants – to name a few possible sub-groups tracked by this indicator – corresponds to the proportion of these groups in society as a whole. More specifically, this indicator measures the proportional representation of various demographic groups (women, youth, persons with disability, and nationally relevant population groups) across four categories of bureaucratic positions in the public service at both national and sub-national levels, namely: (1) Managers, (2) Professionals, (3) Technicians and Associate Professionals and (4) Clerical Support Workers. Among front-line service workers, a particular focus is also placed on four categories of positions, namely: (1) Police Personnel, (2) Education Personnel, (3) Health Personnel and (4) Front-Desk Administrative Personnel (with each category of front-line service workers further sub-divided using the same four levels defined for bureaucratic positions).Indicator 16.7.1(b) aims to compare the proportion of various demographic groups (by sex, age, disability and population groups) represented in the public service, relative to the proportion of these same groups in the national population. A detailed Data Reporting Form with accompanying guidance and definitions is available to assist countries in reporting on this indicator across the eight ISCO-08-based occupational categories identified for the public service, at the level of both national and sub-national government, and on the basis of sex, age groups (<25, 25-34, 35-44,45-54,55-64, >65), nationally relevant population groups and disability status. Countries are encouraged to report data that is available, understanding that public servant disaggregated data for disability status and nationally-relevant population groups may not be currently available in many jurisdictions. Countries are encouraged to build additional capacities to disaggregate data by these demographic groups.  Information for part-time positions should be given in full-time equivalents and should be counted only for permanent posts actually filled. It is important to consider the part-time or full-time status of posts to address the risk that some target groups may be underemployed and over-reported (e.g. If women are more likely to receive part-time posts than full-time posts, there might be a false impression that women are equally represented in those posts, when in reality they work less than their male counterparts due to their part-time status).  When comparing ratios of certain groups in the public service with corresponding shares of the same groups in the national population, it is important to use the working-age population of that group in the national population as a comparator i.e. above the minimum age required to apply for a public servant job, and below the mandatory retirement age for public servants. These lower and upper age boundaries will vary depending on the country, and need to be defined by each country in the below formula. For instance, let's say that the minimum age to be eligible for a public service job in a given country is 18 years old, and the mandatory retirement age for public servants is 65 years old. When comparing public servants belonging to a particular population group (say, a particular ethnic group) with the corresponding share of this ethnic group in the national population, it is important to focus only on those members of this ethnic group aged between 18 and 65. Global reporting on indicator 16.7.1(b) can be done in two steps: Step 1: Reporting simple proportions of women, 'youth', persons with a disability, and specific population groups across each occupational category in the public service, at both national and sub-national government levelsNote: With regards to age disaggregation, a specific focus on  youth  is recommended, using the cut-off age of 34 or younger at the time of data collection. Employment in public service at NATIONAL/CENTRAL levelEmployment in public service at SUB-NATIONAL levelStep 2: Generating ratios comparing the proportion of women, 'youth', persons with a disability, and specific population groups in the public service relative to the proportion of the same groups in the national population, across each occupational category, at both national and sub-national government levelsEmployment in public service at NATIONAL/CENTRAL level(Same ratios to be calculated for employment in public service at SUB-NATIONAL level, in separate table)Countries are expected to fill out the above table to the best of their ability, and to report as many representation ratios as possible, for women, 'youth', persons with a disability, and specific population groups, across all occupational categories, at both national and sub-national levels. Meanwhile, global reporting on indicator 16.7.1(b) will focus on 4 'overall ratios' (see highlighted cells in the table above), namely: Ratios 1a) and b): Representation of female public servants 'overall' (across all occupational categories) and representation of women in the 'Manager' category (separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): These two ratios are important because women remain significantly underrepresented in the public service across all regions, both in the public service as a whole and in the top levels of the public service (UNDP, Gender Equality in Public Administration – GEPA, 2014). The target of a minimum of 30 percent of women in leadership positions, originally endorsed by ECOSOC in 1990 and reaffirmed in the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995, remains unmet in most countries. For instance, according to the Worldwide Index of Women as Public Sector Leaders developed by Ernst & Young, across the G20 major economies, women represent less than 20 percent of public sector leadership. Ratio 2: Representation of 'young' public servants aged 34 and below across all occupational categories (separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): This ratio is important because in several countries, there is a significant age gap between those in public service and the people they serve (UNDP GEPA, 2014), which has been found to undermine young people's trust in public institutions (OECD, 2017). To remedy this situation, the UN Security Council has urged Member States to  consider ways to increase inclusive representation of youth in decision-making at all levels in local, national, regional and international institutions  (UN SC Resolution 2250 (2015).Ratio 3: Representation of public servants with a disability across all occupational categories (separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): This ratio is important because persons with disabilities remain significantly underrepresented in the public service, and under Article 31 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), State Parties have committed to collecting disaggregated information to give effect to the Convention's call to ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in public life on an equal basis with others.Ratio 4: Representation of public servants belonging to Population Group A (B,C,D, etc.) across all occupational categories (separate ratios for national and sub-national levels): This ratio important because evidence shows that when public servants resemble the people they provide services to, with respect to their ethnic, linguistic or religious affiliations, or to their indigenous status, citizens perceive the public service to be more legitimate. Proportional representation of nationally-relevant population groups in the public service has been found to be associated with higher levels of public trust in public institutions.Guidance on how to calculate these four ratios is provided below: To calculate Ratio 1a) for female public servants in the 'Manager' category, the following formula is to be used:Ratio 1a) = 	Proportion of women in the 'Manager' category in the public service*               Proportion of women in the working-age population  *Ratios for national and sub-national levels to be calculated separatelyWhere: The numerator is the number of jobs held by women in the 'Manager' category in the public service, divided by the total number of public servants in the 'Manager' category The denominator can be set at 50, as women generally represent around 50% of the national population in any given age bracket. The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of women at all in the 'Manager' category in the public service<1, when the proportion of women in the 'Manager' category in the public service is lower than women's share in the working-age population =1, when the proportion of women in the 'Manager' category in the public service equals women's share in the working-age population>1, when the proportion of women in the 'Manager' category in the public service is higher than women's share in the working-age populationExample: Say in country A, 10% of public servants in the 'Manager' category are women: Ratio 1a) = 10 / 50 = 0.2 (<1 since women in the 'Manager' category are under-represented, and the ratio is small given the share of women in this occupational category is far from parity)To calculate Ratio 1b) for female public servants across the public service as a whole, the following formula is to be used:Ratio 1b) = 	Proportion of women across all occupational categories in the public service*   Proportion of women in the working-age population  *Ratios for national and sub-national levels to be calculated separatelyWhere: The numerator is the number of jobs held by women across all occupational categories in the public service, divided by the total number of public servants across all occupational categoriesThe denominator can be set at 50, as women generally represent around 50% of the national population in any given age bracket. The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of women at all in the public service<1, when the proportion of women in the public service is lower than women's share in the working-age population =1, when the proportion of women in the public service equals women's share in the working-age population>1, when the proportion of women in the public service is higher than women's share in the working-age populationExample: Say in country A, 35% of public across all occupational categories are women: Ratio 1b) = 40 / 50 = 0.8 (<1 since women in the public service are under-represented, and the ratio is higher given the share of women in the public service is not so far from parity)To calculate Ratio 2 for 'young' public servants (aged 34 and below) across all occupational categories, the following formula is to be used: Ratio 2 = 	                    Proportion of public servants aged 34 and below*		 Proportion of the national population aged 34 and below *Ratios for national and sub-national levels to be calculated separatelyWhere: The numerator is the number of jobs in the public service held by public servants aged 34 and below across all occupational categories, divided by the total number of public servants (across all occupational categories) The denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows, keeping in mind that when assessing the representation of 'young' public servants (aged 34 and below), the national population to be used as a comparator will be above the age of eligibility for a public service job, and below 34 (not 0-34): [Size of national population < or = to 34] – [Size of national population < age of eligibility for a public service job]								 		Size of national populationThe resulting ratio can be:  0, when there is no representation at all of 'youth' (34 years and below) in the public service<1, when the proportion of 'youth' (34 years and below) in the public service is lower than youth's share in the national population1, when the proportion of 'youth' (34 years and below) in the public service equals youth's share in the national population>1, when the proportion of 'youth' (34 years and below) in the public service is higher than youth's share in the national population  Note: While a simple proportion of 'young' public servants is not internationally comparable, a ratio computed using the above formula is. For instance, 32% of 'young' public servants (34 years old or younger) may be an over-representation of youth in country A where only 20% of the national population (above eligibility age for a public service job) falls in this age bracket (Ratio 3 = 38/20 = 1.6), but in country B where 40% of the national population is 34 years old or younger (and above eligibility age for a public service job), the same 32% would be interpreted as under-representation (Ratio = 32/40 = 0.8). In this example, the figure of 32% is not internationally comparable (it means over-representation in one country and under-representation in another), but the ratios 1.6 and 0.8 are internationally comparable. They help us understand whether 32% of public servants aged 34 years old or less is close to, or far from, proportional representation of this age group in the national population. Example: Say in the same country A, 20% of public servants are aged 34 and below, and the corresponding share of the national population aged between 18 (the eligibility age for public service jobs in country A) and 34 is 20%:Ratio 2 = 20 / 20 = 1(=1 since the proportion of public servants aged 34 or younger equals the share of this age group (i.e. > or = to 18 and < or = to 34) in the national population.)To calculate Ratio 3 for public servants with a disability across all occupational categories, the following formula is to be used:Ratio 3 = 	               Proportion of Persons With Disabilities (PWD) in the public service*    	           Proportion of Persons With Disabilities in the working-age population *Ratios for national and sub-national levels to be calculated separatelyWhere: The numerator is the number of jobs in the public service held by PWD, divided by the total number of public servants (across all occupational categories)The denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows: [Population size of PWD in the national population < or = to age of mandatory retirement] – [Population size of PWD in the national population < to age of eligibility for a public service job][Size of national population < or = to age of mandatory retirement] – [Size of national population < to age of eligibility for a public service job]The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of PWD at all in the public service <1, when the proportion of PWD in the public service is lower than the share of PWD in the working-age population =1, when the proportion of PWD in the public service equals the share of PWD in the working-age population>1, when the proportion of PWD in the public service is higher than the share of PWD in the working-age populationExample: Say in the same country A, 2% of public servants have a disability, when nationally, PWD make up 8% of the national population:  Ratio 3 = 2 / 8 = 0.25 (<1 since PWD in the public service are under-represented)To calculate Ratio 4 for 'Population Group A' in the public service across all occupational categories, the following formula is to be used (this formula should be applied for each population group for which data is available):Ratio 4 = 	     	Proportion of 'Population Group A' in the public service    		           Proportion of 'Population Group A' in the working-age population Where: The numerator is the number of jobs in the public service held by 'Population Group A', divided by the total number of public servants (across all occupational categories)The denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows: [Size of 'Population Group A' in the national population < or = to age of mandatory retirement] – [Size of 'Population Group A' in the national population < age of eligibility for a public service job][Size of national population < or = to age of mandatory retirement] – [Size of national population < to age of eligibility for a public service job]The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of 'Population Group A' at all in the public service <1, when the proportion of 'Population Group A' in the public service is lower than the share of 'Population Group A' in the working-age population =1, when the proportion of 'Population Group A' in the public service equals the share of 'Population Group A' in the working-age population>1, when the proportion of 'Population Group A' in the public service is higher than the share of 'Population Group A' in the working-age population"
"Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels","Target 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels  ","Indicator 16.7.1: Proportions of positions (by sex, age, persons with disabilities and population groups) in public institutions (national and local), including (a) the legislatures; (b) the public service; and (c) the judiciary, compared to national distributions. ","The judiciary sub-component of indicator 16.7.1 aims to measure how representative of the general population are the individuals occupying two key decision-making positions in the judiciary. More specifically, this indicator measures the proportional representation of various socio-demographic groups in the national population (with a particular focus on sex, age, disability, and population groups) amongst individuals occupying the positions of (1) judges and (2) registrars in the judiciary. The judiciary is the system of courts that constitutes the branch of central authority in a country concerned with the administration of justice. The judiciary sub-component of SDG indicator 16.7.1 focuses on the formal court system and does not include within its scope informal mechanisms (e.g., religious, tribal, or traditional dispute resolution mechanisms). Indicator 16.7.1(c) aims to compare the proportion of various demographic groups (by sex, age, disability status, and population group) represented in two key decision-making positions in the judiciary, namely judges and registrars, relative to the proportion of these same groups in the national population of working-age.Countries are encouraged to report data that is available, understanding that disaggregated data for disability status and nationally-relevant population groups may not be currently available in many jurisdictions. Countries are encouraged to build additional capacities to disaggregate data by these demographic groups.  Information for part-time positions should be given in full-time equivalents and should be counted only for permanent posts actually filled. It is important to consider the part-time or full-time status of posts to address the risk that some target groups may be underemployed and over-reported (e.g., if women are more likely to receive part-time posts than full-time posts, there might be a false impression that women are equally represented in those posts, when in reality they adjudicate a smaller portion of cases than their male counterparts due to their part-time status).  Judges:Global reporting on indicator 16.7.1(c) for judges can be done in two steps: Step 1: Reporting simple proportions of (a) female judges, (b) 'young' judges aged 44 and below, (c) judges with a disability, and (d) judges in nationally-relevant population group(s) in the judiciary in (i) constitutional/ supreme courts, (ii) higher-level courts, and (iii) lower-level courts. The table below should be filled with both actual figures (e.g. number of 'young' judges in higher-level courts, over the total number of judges in higher-level courts) and proportions expressed in a percentage format.Step 2: Generating ratios comparing the proportion of (a) female judges, (b) 'young' judges aged 44 and below, (c) judges with a disability, and (d) judges in nationally-relevant population group(s) in the judiciary across all levels of courts relative to the proportion of the same target groups in the national population of working-age. Four or more overall ratios across all levels of courts must be calculated, namely: For female judges;For 'young' judges (44 years and below);  For judges with a disability; and For judges belonging to population groups (1 or more ratios, as nationally-relevant).When comparing ratios of certain target groups in the judiciary with corresponding shares of the same groups in the national population, it is important to consider the 'working-age population' of that group in the national population as a comparator, i.e. those at or above the minimum age required to apply for, or be nominated for, a job as a judge within the judiciary (the 'eligibility age') and below the age at which retirement is mandatory for judges within the judiciary (the 'mandatory retirement age'). In other words, if the eligibility age in a given country is 18 years old and the mandatory retirement age is 70 years old, the national working-age population to be used as a comparator for the first ratio (for 'young' judges) will be the national population aged 18-44 (not 0-44) and the national population to be used as a comparator for the third ratio (judges with a disability) will be persons with a disability in the national population aged 18-70. To calculate the ratio for female judges, the following formula is to be used: Ratio 1 = 	 	 Proportion of women judges (across all levels of courts)	____         Proportion of women in the working-age population Where: The numerator is the number of posts held by female judges (across all levels of courts), divided by the total number of judges (across all levels of courts)The denominator can be set at 50% in most countries, as women generally represent around 50% of the national population in any given age bracket. The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of women at all as judges <1, when the proportion of women as judges is lower than that in the national working-age population =1, when the proportion of women as judges equals that in the national working-age population>1, when the proportion of women as judges is higher than that in the national working-age populationTo calculate the ratio for 'young' judges (44 years old or below), the following formula is to be used: Ratio 2 = 	         Proportion of judges 44 years old or below (across all levels of courts)	     Proportion of the national population 44 years old or below   (with the eligibility age as a lower boundary)Where: The numerator is the number of judges aged 44 or below (across all levels of courts), divided by the total number of judges (across all levels of courts)The denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows: [Size of national population aged 44 or below] – [Size of national population < eligibility age]Size of the national populationThe resulting ratio for 'young' (aged 44 or below) judges can then be interpreted as follows:  0 means no representation at all of 'young' (aged 44 or below) judges 1 means perfectly proportional representation of 'young' (aged 44 or below) judges<1 means under-representation of 'young' (aged 44 or below) judges>1 means over-representation of 'young' (aged 44 or below) judgesWhile a simple proportion of 'young' judges in the judiciary is not internationally comparable, a ratio computed using the above formula is. For instance, 48% of 'young' judges (aged 44 or below) may be an overrepresentation of youth in country A where only 30% of the national population of working-age falls in this age bracket (Ratio = 48/30 = 1.6), but in country B where 70% of the national population of working-age is aged 44 and below, the same 48% would be interpreted as under-representation (Ratio = 48/70 = 0.69). In this example, the figure of 48% is not internationally comparable in relation to the national population (it means over-representation in one country and under-representation in another), but the ratios 1.6 and 0.69 are internationally comparable. They help us understand whether 48% of judges aged 44 and below is close to, or far from, proportional representation of this age group in the national population. To calculate the ratio for judges with a disability, the following formula is to be used: Ratio 3 = 	 	   Proportion of judges with a disability (across all levels of courts) _ 		Proportion of persons with disability in the national working-age population Where: The numerator is the number of posts held by judges with a disability (across all levels of courts), divided by the total number of judges (across all levels of courts)The denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows: [Size of PWD in the national population < or = mandatory retirement age] –[Size of PWD in the national population < eligibility age][Size of national population < or = mandatory retirement age] –[Size of national population < eligibility age]The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of persons with disability at all as judges <1, when the proportion of persons with disability as judges is lower than that in the national working-age population =1, when the proportion of persons with disability as judges equals that in the national working-age population>1, when the proportion of persons with disability as judges is higher than that in the national working-age populationTo calculate the ratio for judges belonging to population groups, the following formula is to be used for each nationally-relevant population group: Ratio 4 = 	 __Proportion of judges belonging to population group X (across all levels of courts)__ Proportion of population group X in working-age population Where: The numerator is the number of posts held by judges belonging to population group X (across all levels of courts), divided by the total number of judges (across all levels of courts)The denominator can be computed using national population figures as follows: [Size of population group X in the national population < or = mandatory retirement age] –[Size of population group X in the national population < eligibility age][Size of national population group X < or = mandatory retirement age] –[Size of national population group X < eligibility age]The resulting ratio can be:0, when there is no representation of the population group X at all as judges <1, when the proportion of the population group X as judges is lower than that in the national working-age population =1, when the proportion of the population group X as judges equals that in the national working-age population>1, when the proportion of the population group X as judges is higher than that in the national working-age populationRegistrars:Global reporting on indicator 16.7.1(c) for registrars can also be done in two steps: Step 1: Reporting simple proportions of (a) female registrars, (b) 'young' registrars aged 44 and below, (c) registrars with a disability, and (d) registrars in nationally-relevant population group(s) in the judiciary in (i) constitutional/ supreme courts, (ii) higher-level courts, and (iii) lower-level courts.  The table below should be filled with both actual figures (e.g. number of 'young' registrars in higher-level courts, over the total number of registrars in higher-level courts) and proportions expressed in a percentage format.Step 2: Generating ratios comparing the proportion of (a) female registrars, (b) 'young' registrars aged 44 and below, (c) registrars with a disability, and (d) registrars in nationally-relevant population group(s) in the judiciary across all levels of courts relative to the proportion of the same target groups in the national population of working-age. Four or more ratios must be calculated, namely: For female registrars;For 'young' registrars (44 years and below); For registrars with a disability; and For registrars belonging to population groups (1 or more ratios, as nationally relevant).The same calculations used to calculate ratios (1) (2), (3) and (4) for judges will be used for registrars. The lower and upper boundaries used for the working-age population will be the eligibility age and the mandatory retirement age for registrars, as applicable. "

International human rights law refers to the body of international legal instruments aiming to promote and protect human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations.Number of survey respondents who felt that they personally experienced discrimination or harassment on one or more prohibited grounds of discrimination during the last 12 months, divided by the total number of survey respondents, multiplied by 100.To minimize the effect of forward telescoping, the module asks two questions: a first question about the respondent's experience over the last 5 years, and a second question about the last 12 months:Question 1: In [COUNTRY], do you feel that you personally experienced any form of discrimination or harassment during the last 5 years, namely since [YEAR OF INTERVIEW MINUS 5] (or since you have been in the country), on the following grounds?Question 2: In [COUNTRY], do you feel that you  personally experienced any form of discrimination or harassment during the past 12 months, namely since [MONTH OF INTERVIEW] [YEAR OF INTERVIEW MINUS 1], on any of these grounds?The proposed survey module recommends that interviewer reads or the data collection mechanism provides a short definition of discrimination/harassment to the respondent before asking the questions. Providing respondents with a basic introduction to these notions helps improve their comprehension and recall of incidents. Following consultations with experts and complementary cognitive testing, the following introductory text is recommended: Discrimination happens when you are treated less favourably compared to others or harassed because of the way you look, where you come from, what you believe or for other reasons. You may be refused equal access to work, housing, healthcare, education, marriage or family life, the police or justice system, shops, restaurants, or any other services or opportunities. You may also encounter comments, gestures or other behaviours that make you feel offended, threatened or insulted, or have to stay away from places or activities to avoid such behaviours.The proposed survey module also recommends that a list of grounds is provided to respondents to facilitate comprehension and recall of incidents. As a starting point, OHCHR recommends the use of the following list of grounds prohibited by international human rights law and adding an  any other ground  category to capture grounds that are not explicitly listed. The module recommends that the following illustrative list is reviewed and contextualised at national level through a participatory process (see HRBAD and accompanying guidance) to reflect specific population groups and data collection/disaggregation needs:1. SEX: such as being a woman or a man2. AGE: such as being perceived to be too young or too old3. DISABILITY OR HEALTH STATUS: such as having difficulty in seeing, hearing, walking or moving, concentrating or communicating, having a disease or other health conditions and no reasonable accommodation provided for it4. ETHNICITY, COLOUR OR LANGUAGE: such as skin colour or physical appearance, ethnic origin or way of dressing, culture, traditions, native language, indigenous status, or being of African descent 5. MIGRATION STATUS: such as nationality or national origin, country of birth, refugees, asylum seekers, migrant status, undocumented migrants or stateless persons6. SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS: such as wealth or education level, being perceived to be from a lower or different social or economic group or class, land or home ownership or not 7. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OR PLACE OF RESIDENCE: such as living in urban or rural areas, formal or informal settlements8. RELIGION: such as having or not a religion or religious beliefs9. MARITAL AND FAMILY STATUS: such as being single, married, divorced, widowed, pregnant, with or without children, orphan or born from unmarried parents10. SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY: such as being attracted to person of the same sex, self-identifying differently from sex assigned at birth or as being either sexually, bodily and/or gender diverse 11.

GFS revenue series maintained by the IMF Statistics Department are collected in Table 1 of the standard annual data questionnaire. Each revenue transaction is classified according to whether it is a tax or another type of revenue. GFS revenue aggregates are summations of individual entries and elements in this particular class of flows and allow for these data to be arranged in a manageable and analytically useful way. For example, tax revenue is the sum of all flows that are classified as taxes. Conceptually, the value for each main revenue aggregate is the sum of the values for all items in the relevant category. The annual GFS series for monitoring Indicator 17.1.1will be derived from the data reported by the national authorities (in national currency) expressed as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), where GDP is derived from the IMF World Economic Outlook database (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor will the calculation change over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities in the underlying series as these are key aggregates/ components in all country reported GFS series). The presentation will closely align with that currently contained in World Table 4 from the hard-copy GFS Yearbook: Historic series have been aligned with GFSM 2014 classifications.

Budgetary central government, described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81) is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government's revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 2.42).  including references to standards and classifications, preferably relying on international agreed definitions. The indicator definition should be unambiguous and expressed in universally applicable terms. It must clearly express the unit of measurement (proportion, dollars, number of people, etc.).GFS budgetary central government revenue series - collected in Table 1 of the annual data questionnaire provided to all countries - will be combined with series on budgetary central government expenditure (actual execution of the main budget) on  expense  plus the  net acquisition of nonfinancial assets , as defined in GFSM 2014).  GFS Expenditure series are reported by the economic classification in Tables 2, and 3 (items under code 31). Alternatively, for those countries that report total expenditure according to the functional classification (COFOG) in GFS Table 7, a similar calculation can be made. The Proportion of domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes will be calculated as (Taxes / Expenditure expressed as a %) using the following data series:
Consistency across countries will be ensured through the underlying structure of the IMF GFS database and application of one simple mathematical formulas to make computations on the country reported source data used to produce the indicator (no adjustments and/or weighting techniques will be applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor will the calculation change over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities in the underlying series as these are key aggregates/ components in all country reported GFS series)."

Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development,Target 17.15: Respect each country's policy space and leadership to establish and implement policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development,Indicator 17.15.1: Extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools by providers of development cooperation,"This indicator measures the extent to which, and the ways in which, all concerned development partners use country-led results frameworks (CRFs) to plan development cooperation efforts and assess their performance.  The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country government-led results frameworks reflecting the country's development priorities and goals.  To provide a comprehensive measure on the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and other government-led planning tools, the indicator calculates the degree to which objectives, results indicators and monitoring frameworks associated with new development interventions are drawn from government sources –including national, sector and subnational planning tools.For each development intervention of significant size (US$ 100,000 and above) approved during the year of reference, the following dimensions are assessed:Q1. Whether objectives are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies 0/1Q2. Share of results (outcome) indicators that are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies %Q3. Share of results (outcome) indicators that will rely on sources of data provided by existing country-led monitoring systems or national statistical services to track project progress %Aggregated averages per partner country will provide an assessment of the country's available policy space and leadership. All formulas are available at: Aggregated averages per development partner will indicate the percentage of alignment with country-led priority setting mechanisms. Formulas are available at: Note that data to weight the results by development partner's actual contributions in terms of development finance is available, if requested by the IAEG SDG / UN Statistical Commission. A global aggregate for the indicator is obtained by averaging the three dimensions of alignment with country's priorities and goals across all new interventions for the reporting year. Formulas are available at: When aggregating, the size of the project/ intervention is not considered as weight in order to give the same level of importance to the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools in medium-sized vs. larger projects, as the indicator tries to capture the overall behaviour of development partners in designing new interventions in a given country. Weighting by project size would otherwise over represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available."

To reflect the universal nature of target 17.16 this indicator is presented as the global aggregate number of countries reporting progress. For any country reporting towards one (or more) multi-stakeholder development effectiveness framework(s), the country is considered to be reporting progress when, for the year of reference, the number of indicators within the framework(s) that show a positive trend is greater than the number of indicators that show a negative trend.Countries providing development co-operation funding and reporting in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are assessed against the following elements: Aligning to country-defined development objectives: Percentage of new development interventions whose objectives are drawn from country-led results frameworks.Using country-led results frameworks: Percentage of results indicators contained in new development interventions which are drawn from country-led results frameworks.Using national monitoring and statistical systems: Percentage of results indicators in new development interventions which will be monitored using government sources and monitoring systems.Using national evaluation systems: Percentage of new interventions that plan a final evaluation with country government involvement.Transparency of development co-operation: Public availability of information on development co‑operation according to international reporting standards. Annual predictability of development co-operation: Proportion of development co-operation disbursed as development partners had scheduled at the beginning of the year. Medium-term predictability of development co-operation: forward-looking spending plans made available to the partner government (indicative annual amounts of development co-operation support to be provided over the one-to-three years. Development co-operation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight: share of development co-operation funds planned to/for the country's public sevtor that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.Development co-operation delivered through country systems: Proportion of development co-operation disbursed to a give country according to national regulations and systems for public financial management (i.e. budgeting, financial reporting, auditing) and procurement.Untied Aid: Proportion of development co-operation that is untiedCountries receiving development co-operation funding and reporting in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are assessed against the following elements: Leading in setting up national priorities: Countries strengthen their national results frameworks.Creating an enabling environment for civil society organisations: Civil society organizations operate within an environment that maximises their engagement in and contribution to development.Promoting private sector engagement and contribution to development: Quality of public-private dialogue Recording development co-operation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight: Share of development co-operation funds planned to/for the country's public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.Strengthening mutual accountability: Mutual accountability among development actors is strengthened through inclusive reviews.Strengthening gender equality and women's empowerment: Existence of transparent government systems to track public allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment Strengthening domestic institutions: Quality of the country's budgetary and public financial management.Countries providing and receiving development co-operation funding are invited to select whether they would like to report against provider-specific commitments, against recipient-specific commitments, or against both sets of commitments.For countries reporting both as providers and recipients of development co-operation, progress is calculated separately based on the respective set of indicators described above. Disaggregated results will show the detailed performance in each category. For the ultimate count of the number of countries making progress, dual countries are accounted as making progress if progress is made as recipient or as provider of development co-operation.  The baseline for counting progress is the latest measurement available for each specific country, dating back to 2010. When no baseline exists for a country, the first measurement available for an indicator constitutes the baseline for future measurements of progress.When a country meets and sustains all targets for the indicators it reports on (i.e. it is logically impossible to make further progress) it is considered as  making progress .

In a given country or area, the level of completeness of birth registration can be different from the level of completeness of death registration. There exist several methods for the evaluation of completeness of birth or death registration systems. An elaboration of these methods is available at Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3.  The evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness  of birth and death registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub-Chapters: D. Quality assessment methods; E. Direct versus indirect assessment,  and F. Choosing appropriate methods for assessing completeness and qualitative accuracy of registration and register-based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).Indicator 17.19.2(b) has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning the death registration of each individual country or area.  The two sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) are expressed as proportions: at the global level, the proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration is measured as the number of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration to the total number of countries. The computation is done in an analogous manner for the death registration part as well as for the regional measurements of both birth and death registration sub-indicators. The latest compiled data for this indicator are part of the Statistical Annex to the 2017 SG's progress report, available at  (please refer to the last two pages). These data are compiled using the country-reported information on availability and completeness of birth and death registration data at the country level, to the United Nations Demographic Yearbook, via the Demographic Yearbook Vital Statistics questionnaire and accompanying metadata. United Nations Demographic Yearbook collection and associated online compilations are published by the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Please refer to:  At the present time, the thresholds used for compiling the data for the indicator 17.19.2(b) are 90 per cent for birth registration and 75 per cent for death registration, due to the classification that has been used in the Demographic Yearbook metadata questionnaire on vital statistics.

The severity of food insecurity, defined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014.Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions associated with food insecurity. The data is analysed using the Rasch model (also known as one-parameter logistic model, 1-PL), which postulates that the probability of observing an affirmative answer by respondent i to question j, is a logistic function of the distance, on an underlying scale of severity, between the position of the respondent, , and that of the item, .Parameters  and  can be estimated using maximum likelihood procedures. Parameters , in particular, are interpreted as a measure of the severity of the food security condition for each respondent and are used to classify them into classes of food insecurity.The FIES considers the three classes of (a) food security or mild food insecurity; b) moderate or severe food insecurity, and (c) severe food insecurity, and estimates the probability of being moderately or severely food insecure () and the probability of being severely food insecure () for each respondent, with . The probability of being food secure or mildly food insecure can be obtained as .Given a representative sample, the prevalence of food insecurity at moderate or severe levels (FImod+sev), and at severe levels (FIsev) in the population are computed as the weighted sum of the probability of belonging to the moderate or severe food insecurity class, and to the severe food insecurity class, respectively, of all individual or household respondents in a sample:and  where  are post-stratification weights that indicate the proportion of individual or households in the national population represented by each element in the sample.It is important to note that if  are individual sampling weights, then the prevalence of food insecurity refers to the total population of individuals, while if they are household weights, the prevalence refers to the population of households. For the calculation of the indicator 2.1.2, objective is to produce a prevalence of individuals. This implies that:if a survey is at household level, and provides household sampling weights, they should be transformed to individual sampling weights by multiplying the weights by the household size. This individual weighting system can then be used to calculate the individual prevalence rates in formulas (1) and (2)If the survey includes only adults, then the adult weights applied to the probabilities in formulas (1) and (2) provide the adult prevalence rates (). In this case, to calculate the prevalence in the total population, then the proportion of children who live in households where at least one adult is food insecure must also be calculated. This can be done by dividing the adult weights by the number of adults in the household and multiplying those approximate household weights by the number of children in the household. Once the approximate child weights are obtained, the prevalence of food insecurity of children who live in households where at least one adult is food insecure () can be calculated by applying these weights to the probabilities of food insecurity in formulas (1) and (2). The prevalence of food insecurity in the total population is finally calculated as:and  Where  and  are the adult and children populations in the country.When applied to the country total population, the prevalence of food insecurity in the total population provides the number of individuals who live in food insecure households (or in households where at least one adult is food insecure) in a country, at different levels of severity ( and ). In the database, the number of food insecure people are expressed in thousands. "
"Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture","Target 2.3: By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment",Indicator 2.3.1: Volume of production per labour unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size,"Volume of agricultural production of small-scale food producer in crop, livestock, fisheries, and forestry activities per number of days.The indicator is computed as a ratio of annual output to the number of working days in one year. FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who: operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units – TLUs); and obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars.where:  is the physical volume of agricultural product i sold by the small-scale food producer j during year t;  is the constant sale price received by the small-scale food producer j for the agricultural product i during same year t;  is the number of labour days utilized by the small-scale food producer j during year t; is the number of small-scale food producer. As the indicator is referred to a set of production units – those of a small scale — the denominator needs to summarize information on the entire production undertaken in each unit. This requires that volumes of production are reported in a common numeraire, given that it is impossible to sum up physical units. The most convenient numeraire for aggregating products in the numerator is a vector of constant prices. When measured at different points in time, as required by the monitoring of the SDG indicators, changes in constant values represent aggregated volume changes. "

FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who: operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units – TLUs); and obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars.Given i agricultural activities, including crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry activities, and j [1,…,n] small scale food producers defined as in the first section as a subset of all N [1,…,k] food producers, the SDG indicator 2.3.2 must be computed using the following formula: where:  is the physical volume of agricultural product i sold by the small-scale food producer j during year t;  is the constant sale price received by the small-scale food producer j for the agricultural product i during year t;  is the production cost of agricultural product i supported by the small-scale food producer j during year t; is the number of small-scale food producer. In details, physical volumes are derived, for each k producer, from the following items:Crop revenues: crop sold, crop for own consumption, crop used as feed, crop saved for seed, crop stored, crop used for by-products, crop given as gift, crop used for paying labour, crop used for paying rent, crop used for paying inputs, crop given out in sharecropping agreement (sharecrop out), crop wasted. Similar criteria apply for the computation of revenues from tree crops and forestry products. Livestock revenues: livestock sold (alive), livestock gifts given away (component can only be kept if stock variation is possible to construct), livestock by-/products sold, livestock products self-consumed, livestock by-products self-used (also a cost in crop, for example dung used as fertilisers), livestock by-/products pay away, livestock by-/products credit away. Forestry revenues: products sold, forestry products for own consumption, forestry products stored, forestry products used for paying labour, forestry products used for paying rent, forestry products used for paying inputs, forestry products given out in sharecropping agreement, Forestry products wasted.Fisheries revenues: captured fresh fish sold, captured processed fish sold, captured fresh fish for own consumption, captured processed fish for own consumption, traded fresh fish sold, traded processed fish sold.Production costs  are meant to include operating costs. These comprise all variable costs (payments in cash and kind of agricultural inputs as fertiliser, seeds, and occasional labour) and fixed costs (hired labour, land rent and technical assistance costs). In more details, costs  generally include the following items: Costs of crop activities: inputs paid in cash, land rent, technical assistance/extension costs, crop saved for seed, crop used for paying labour, crop used for paying rent, crop used for paying inputs, crop given out in sharecropping agreement (sharecrop out), crop wasted, crop used for producing by-products, total value of input purchased, including those reimbursed in kind Costs of livestock activities: livestock bought, livestock additional expenditures, crop used as feed, technical assistance/extension costs for livestock, Costs of forestry activities: input costs (seedlings, fertilisers, hired labour, etc.), machine rental costs, land rental costs, other related costs. Costs of fisheries and aquaculture activities: fishing gear expenditures, hired labour expenditures, trading activities, fresh fish purchases, processed fish purchases, other related costs To obtain comparable results across countries in the case of income, values must necessarily be expressed in International Dollars at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP $), based on the conversion provided by the World Bank International Comparison Project.

"Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture","Target 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality",Indicator 2.4.1: Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture,"The indicator is defined by the formula:This implies the need to measure both the extent of land under productive and sustainable agriculture (the numerator), as well as the extent of land area under agriculture (the denominator).The numerator captures the three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental, economic and social. It corresponds to agricultural area of the farms that satisfy sub-indicators selected across all three dimensions.The denominator is agricultural land area managed by agricultural holdings, defined as the sum of agricultural area utilized by agricultural holdings that are owned (excluding rented-out), rented-in, leased, sharecropped or borrowed. State or communal land used by farm holdings is not included. Please see the methodological document prepared by FAO for a more detailed explanation.Indicator 2.4.1 focuses on agricultural land, and therefore primarily on land that is used to grow crops and raise livestock. This choice of scope is fully consistent with the intended use of a country's agricultural area as the denominator of the aggregate indicator.Included within the scope:Both intensive and extensive production systems (including intensive livestock production).Subsistence agriculture.State and common land when used exclusively and managed by the holding.Food and non-food crops and livestock products (example crops such as tobacco, cotton, and livestock raised for non-food products like sheep for wool). Crops grown for fodder or for energy purposes.Agro-forestry (trees on the farm).Aquaculture, to the extent that it takes place within the agricultural area. For example, rice-fish farming and similar systems. Excluded from the scope:State and common land not used exclusively by the agriculture holding.Nomadic pastoralism.Production from gardens and backyards. Production from hobby farms.Holdings focusing exclusively on aquaculture. Forest and other wooded lands, when not part of an agricultural holding.Food harvested from the wild.Steps to calculate SDG 2.4.1 include:Determining the scope of the indicator: The choice made for indicator 2.4.1 is to focus on crops and livestock production thus excluding forestry, fisheries and aquaculture.Determining the dimensions to be covered: The choice made for indicator 2.4.1 is to include environmental, economic and social dimensions in the sustainability assessment. Choosing the scale for the sustainability assessment: The choice made for indicator 2.4.1 is farm level with aggregation to higher levels.Selecting the data collection instrument(s).Selecting the themes within each dimension, and choosing a sub-indicator for each theme. Assessing sustainability performance at farm level for each sub-indicator: Specific sustainability criteria are applied in order to assess the sustainability level of the farm for each theme according to the respective sub-indicators. Deciding the periodicity of monitoring the indicator. Modality of reporting the indicator. The set of sub-indicators are presented in the form of a dashboard. The dashboard described above offers a response in terms of measuring sustainability at farm level and aggregating it at national level.The revised methodology proposes to focus on a dashboard presenting the different sub-indicators separately. The dashboard is chosen for reporting the indicator, as sustainability is about finding an acceptable balance between its three dimensions. It offers several advantages, including the possibility of combining data from different sources and clarity about the main unsustainability issues: countries can easily visualize their performance in terms of the different sustainability dimensions and themes, and understand where policy efforts can be focused.Computation of results and construction of the dashboard is performed for each sub-indicator separately: for each sub-indicator, aggregation at national level is done by summing the agricultural land area of all agricultural holdings by sustainability category, following a 'traffic light' approach (red, yellow or green), and reported as percentage of the total agricultural land area of the country (minus the common land).Several countries have suggested using existing data sources or alternative data sources like remote sensing and GIS on the grounds that these instruments can be more cost-effective and sometimes provide more reliable results than farm surveys. The use of such instruments is allowed, considering that several aspects need to be carefully taken into account prior to using alternative data sources. First of all, it should be demonstrated that the alternative source gives results of at least same quality as the surveys and ensure international comparability. In order to produce consistent and reliable data as per recommended periodicity, it is advised that the use of alternative data sources may be considered when the available datasets fulfill the following criteria:Can be reflected in or attributed to agricultural land area in the country, considering different farm typologies and agricultural regions;Can be associated with the country's agricultural productions systems, particularly crops, livestock and the combinations in between;Capture the same aspect/phenomenon as the proposed farm survey with at least a documented same quality, considering scientific standards;Are representative of the situation at the national level (with respect to agricultural land area) taking into account main agricultural region types; Are compliant with international/national standards and classifications systems in order to ensure the indicator to be internationally comparable; Data are available at the same level of territorial disaggregation as the farm survey. The ways and means to adjust for under-coverage and non-coverage (when needed) should be clearly devised and described;Data collection year and periodicity are homogenous across the sub-indicators.Finally, using different data sources implies that mechanisms should be put in place at the country level to coordinate regularly the flow of required information generated by various institutions."

Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.Plant genetic resources The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an 'accession' is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at ), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (). Animal genetic resources The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds (i.e.  being reported to exist only in one country) stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on  sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed  can be found in the  Guidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). The guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf).Plant genetic resourcesThe plant component of the indicator is calculated as the total number of unique accessions of plant genetic resources secured in medium to long term conservation facilities. This should include all the accessions in base collections, and unique accessions stored in medium term conservation facilities, as active collections, only when these accessions are considered to become part of the national base collections. Base collections may include both seed, field, cryo-preserved or in vitro collections depending on the species conserved and the available facilities in the country.Animal genetic resourcesFor the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections  allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, )."

Risk classes are defined based on population sizes of breeds reported to DAD-IS. The risk class is considered to be  unknown  if (i) no population sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of calculation (10 year cut off point).Links to official definitions/descriptions of the indicator are reported below:The indicator is one out of a set of 3 sub-indicators which are defined in the document CGRFA/WG-AnGR-7/12/7  Targets and indicators for animal genetic resources  (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me514e.pdf) and that are endorsed in their current form by the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its the 14th Session (see par 28 CRRFA-14/13/Report at http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).

It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental causes.Pregnancy-related death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.Late maternal death: The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days, but less than one year after termination of pregnancyComments and limitations:The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:i. The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.ii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population (see Box A2.2). An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15–49 years.Related Statistical measures of maternal mortalityMaternal mortality ratio (MMR): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.Maternal mortality rate (MMRate): Number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age.Adult lifetime risk of maternal death: The probability that a 15-year-old woman will die eventually from a maternal cause.The proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM): The number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among women aged 15–49 years.MethodologyComputation Method:The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. Some countries undertake these adjustments or corrections as part of specialized/confidential enquiries or administrative efforts embedded within maternal mortality monitoring programmes."
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,"Target 3.1: By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births",Indicator 3.1.2: Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel,"Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for newborns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included.The number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth attended by a skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses or midwives) during delivery is expressed as a percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same period."

The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B-splines bias-reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under-five mortality for all countries. See references for details. For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:Civil registration: The under-five mortality rate can be derived from a standard period abridged life table using the age-specific deaths and mid-year population counts from civil registration data to calculate death rates, which are then converted into age-specific probabilities of dying.Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on a summary birth history, a series of questions asked of each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under-five and infant mortality rates.

Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from full birth history module."
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,"Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births",Indicator 3.2.2: Neonatal mortality rate,"The neonatal mortality rate is the probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die before reaching 28 completed days of life, if subject to the age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1,000 live births.Neonatal deaths (deaths during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from national data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME produces neonatal mortality rate estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model, which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of the neonatal mortality rate are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with the UN IGME-estimated under-five mortality rate. See the references for details. For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:Civil registration: The number of children who died during the first 28 days of life and the number of live births are used to calculate neonatal mortality rates.Census and surveys: Censuses often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from full birth histories."

Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,"Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases","Indicator 3.3.3: Malaria incidence per 1,000 population","Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per 1,000 people at risk each year.Malaria incidence (1) is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 population per year with the population of a country derived from projections made by the UN Population Division and the total proportion at risk estimated by a country's National Malaria Control Programme. More specifically, the country estimates what is the proportion at high risk (H) and what is the proportion at low risk (L) and the total population at risk is estimated as UN Population x (H + L).The total number of new cases, T, is estimated from the number of malaria cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into account (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking treatment in the private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at all, and (iii) potential over-diagnosis through the lack of laboratory confirmation of cases. The procedure, which is described in the World malaria report 2009 (2), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness and likelihood that cases are parasite positive) with data obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health-service use. Briefly, where:
a is malaria cases confirmed in public sector
b is suspected cases tested
c is presumed cases (not tested but treated as malaria)
d is reporting completeness
e is test positivity rate (malaria positive fraction) = a/b
f is cases in public sector, calculated by (a + (c x e))/d
g is treatment seeking fraction in public sector
h is treatment seeking fraction in private sector
i is the fraction not seeking treatment, calculated by (1-g-h)/2 
j is cases in private sector, calculated by f x h/g
k is cases not in private and not in public, calculated by f x i/g
T is total cases, calculated by f + j + k. To estimate the uncertainty around the number of cases, the test positivity rate was assumed to have a normal distribution centred on the Test positivity rate value and standard deviation defined as  and truncated to be in the range 0, 1. Reporting completeness was assumed to have one of three distributions, depending on the range or value reported by the NMCP. If the range was greater than 80% the distribution was assumed to be triangular, with limits of 0.8 and 1 and the peak at 0.8. If the range was greater than 50% then the distribution was assumed to be rectangular, with limits of 0.5 and 0.8. Finally, if the range was lower than 50% the distribution was assumed to be triangular, with limits of 0 and 0.5 and the peak at 0.5 (3) . If the reporting completeness was reported as a value and was greater than 80%, a beta distribution was assumed with a mean value of the reported value (maximum of 95%) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 5% round the mean value. The proportions of children for whom care was sought in the private sector and in the public sector were assumed to have a beta distribution, with the mean value being the estimated value in the survey and the standard deviation calculated from the range of the estimated 95% confidence intervals (CI) divided by 4. The proportion of children for whom care was not sought was assumed to have a rectangular distribution, with the lower limit 0 and upper limit calculated as 1 minus the proportion that sought care in public or private sector. Values for the proportion seeking care were linearly interpolated between the years that have a survey, and were extrapolated for the years before the first or after the last survey. Missing values for the distributions were imputed using a mixture of the distribution of the country, with equal probability for the years where values were present or, if there was no value at all for any year in the country, a mixture of the distribution of the region for that year. The data were analysed using the R statistical software (4). Confidence intervals were obtained from 10000 drawns of the convoluted distributions.

For India, the values were obtained at subnational level using the same methodology, but adjusting the private sector for an additional factor due to the active case detection, estimated as the ratio of the test positivity rate in the active case detection over the test positivity rate for the passive case detection. This factor was assumed to have a normal distribution, with mean value and standard deviation calculated from the values reported in 2010. Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Colombia, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar (since 2013), Rwanda, Suriname and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) report cases from the private and public sector together; therefore, no adjustment for private sector seeking treatment was made. For some high-transmission African countries the quality of case reporting is considered insufficient for the above formulae to be applied.  In such cases estimates of the number of malaria cases are derived from information on parasite prevalence obtained from household surveys. First, data on parasite prevalence from nearly 60 000 survey records were assembled within a spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical model, along with environmental and sociodemographic covariates, and data distribution on interventions such as ITNs, antimalarial drugs and IRS. The geospatial model enabled predictions of Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in children aged 2–10 years, at a resolution of 5 × 5 km2, throughout all malaria endemic African countries for each year from 2000 to 2016 (see  for methods on the development of maps by the Malaria Atlas Project). Second, an ensemble model was developed to predict malaria incidence as a function of parasite prevalence. The model was then applied to the estimated parasite prevalence in order to obtain estimates of the malaria case incidence at 5 × 5 km2 resolution for each year from 2000 to 2016. Data for each 5 × 5 km2 area were then aggregated within country and regional boundaries to obtain both national and regional estimates of malaria cases (5). (Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo and Zambia)For most of the elimination countries, the number of indigenous cases registered by the NMCPs are reported without further adjustments.

Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,"Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases",Indicator 3.3.5: Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases,"Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO.Some estimation is required to aggregate data across interventions and diseases. There is an established methodology that has been tested and an agreed international standard. [http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf?ua=1]1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as PC for at least one PC-NTD: People may require PC for more than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced.2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, cysticercosis, dengue, guinea-worm disease, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available.Populations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach."

Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods (see further details in section 3.3).There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator:1. Estimation of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population Prospects 2012 revision. 2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions. 3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs for each five-year age range between 30 and 70. 4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of data available from countries:For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. The ICD codes used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14, and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98 Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of death, can be found on page 6 of this document:NCD Global Monitoring Framework: Indicator Definitions and Specifications.

As a health organization, we rely primarily on the submission of vital registration data from countries' Ministries of Health to WHO (through the official channels). These data, on all causes of death, are then analysed by our colleagues in the Health Information Systems department to decide on how good the data are, that is, determining if there is good completeness and coverage of deaths for all causes. We classified the countries on 4 categories or groups namely,Group1: Countries with death registration data (good vital/ death registration data)Group2: Countries with other sources of information on causes of deathGroup3: Countries with population less than 150 000Group4: Countries without eligible death registration data.The Health Information Systems department analyses the quality and the completeness of the data. For the road safety model, if the country is considered by WHO to have good vital registration (VR) data this means that the country is in group1, then we don't apply a regression model to come up with an estimate (we may, however, project forward if the vital registration data are dated). If the country is considered in group 4 then we apply a negative binomial regression where N is the total road traffic deaths , C is constant term, Xi are a set of explanatory covariates, Pop is the population for the country-year, and ? is the negative binomial error term.For the countries from group 2, the regression method described above was used to project forward the most recent year for which an estimate of total deaths were available.Finally, the countries from group 3 which have a population less than 150,000 and did not have eligible death registration data, regression estimates were not used. Only the reported death were directly without adjustment.More details about this estimation process in Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015."

The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator the estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and census data.In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.In the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the 'own-children' method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census.For a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see Handbook on the Collection of Fertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11 (publicly accessible at ).

Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,"Target 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all","Indicator 3.8.1: Coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged population)","Coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged population).The indicator is an index reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, which is computed as the geometric mean of 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage.The index is computed with geometric means, based on the methods used for the Human Development Index. The calculation of the 3.8.1 indicator requires first preparing the 14 tracer indicators so that they can be combined into the index, and then computing the index from those values. The 14 tracer indicators are first all placed on the same scale, with 0 being the lowest value and 100 being the optimal value. For most indicators, this scale is the natural scale of measurement, e.g., the percentage of infants who have been immunized ranges from 0 to 100 percent. However, for a few indicators additional rescaling is required to obtain appropriate values from 0 to 100, as follows:Rescaling based on a non-zero minimum to obtain finer resolution (this  stretches  the distribution across countries): prevalence of non-raised blood pressure and prevalence of non-use of tobacco are both rescaled using a minimum value of 50%.rescaled value = (X-50)/(100-50)*100Rescaling for a continuous measure: mean fasting plasma glucose, which is a continuous measure (units of mmol/L), is converted to a scale of 0 to 100 using the minimum theoretical biological risk (5.1 mmol/L) and observed maximum across countries (7.1 mmol/L).rescaled value = (7.1 - original value)/(7.1-5.1)*100Maximum thresholds for rate indicators: hospital bed density and health workforce density are both capped at maximum thresholds, and values above this threshold are held constant at 100. These thresholds are based on minimum values observed across OECD countries.rescaled hospital beds per 10,000 = minimum(100, original value / 18*100)		rescaled physicians per 1,000         = minimum(100, original value / 0.9*100)		rescaled psychiatrists per 100,000 = minimum(100, original value / 1*100)		rescaled surgeons per 100,000       = minimum(100, original value / 14*100)Once all tracer indicator values are on a scale of 0 to 100, geometric means are computed within each of the four health service areas, and then a geometric mean is taken of those four values. If the value of a tracer indicator happens to be zero, it is set to 1 (out of 100) before computing the geometric mean. The following diagram illustrates the calculations.Note that in countries with low malaria burden, the tracer indicator for use of insecticide-treated nets is dropped from the calculation."
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,"Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination",Indicator 3.9.1: Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution,"The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years).Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:- Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age);- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking).This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking).Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the following formula:PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi) where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]). Details on the model are published in (Bonjour et al, 2013). The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment of 1 ug/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 5.6 and 8.8 ug/m3, as described elsewhere (Ezzati et al, 2002; Lim et al, 2012). The country population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and lung cancer were calculated using the following formula :PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative risk.The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are explained in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a)."

A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966–976 (2015).  Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is  borrowed  from countries in the same UN sub-region. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year.  In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population.Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution."

Then a proportion of facilities that have accessible medicines is computed. The following steps must be taken to compute the index at the facility level:Review and selection of the core basket of medicines for primary health careEstimate weights for the defined medicines based on regional burden of diseaseMeasure the two dimensions of the access to medicineAvailabilityAffordabilityCombine the two dimensions on availability and affordability (access to medicines)Apply weights to the medicine in the basket according to the regional prevalence of the diseases that are cured, treated, and controlled by these medicinesIdentify whether a facility has a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable The next two steps are calculated at the country level across all the surveyed facilities:Calculate the indicator as the proportion of facilities with accessible medicines in the countryConsideration of the quality of the accessible medicines in the country using a proxyBelow is a more detailed procedure of the index computation.Step 1: Review and selection of the core basket of medicines for primary health care For some of the disease categories captured by the proposed basket of medicines, a therapeutic category of medicine has been specified (e.g. statins, beta blockers, corticosteroids, etc.) and a specific medicine must be identified for monitoring. For example, beclomethasone is used to treat non-communicable respiratory disease and if it is not supplied in a particular country for some policy or market reason, an alternative corticosteroid inhaler must be included in the analysis. In other cases, more than one medicine should be included in the basket per disease category. This will require a preliminary review of the basket before starting the data collection process.Step 2: Estimate weights for the defined medicines based on regional burden of diseaseThe following points must be considered when computing medicines' weights:Equal weights are assigned to medicines that are used to treat, cure, and control the same disease(s) (e.g. gliclazide (or other sulfonylurea), metformin and insulin regular are assigned equal weights according to the diabetes disease burden).For a medicine indicated for multiple diseases, DALYs values for each disease are summed.For a medicine used for treating conditions for children (four medicines from the list) sum of DALYs is computed for males and females at the age between 0 and 14 years. For some of the medicines which cannot be assigned to a specific disease (e.g. paracetamol) the weight is computed as    (where T is a total number of medicines in the surveyed basket) assuming equal use of the medicine relative to other medicines in the core list. For medicines not in the list but  suggested for monitoring  by the country, weight is computed as  assuming a minor relevance of these medicines for this indicator and to avoid major issues in inter-country comparison. To estimate the weight for each medicine, the following steps have to be undertaken:Assign each medicine in the basket to one or several disease(s) that are treated/cured/controlled by that medicine (Annex 1 table 2) Assign to each disease the corresponding DALYs (if several diseases are treated with the same medicine, compute sum of these DALYs accordingly) [ ]Compute total sum of the DALYs per medicine [  ]Compute weight of each medicine as a proportion of the medicine specific DALYs to the total sum of DALYs in the basket [ ]:As an example, the weights computed across regions for year 2015 are represented in Annex 2 table 2.1 and 2.2. Step 3: Measure the two dimensions of access to medicineAvailability and affordability of medicines must be measured and transformed (when necessary) into the format of a binary variable. Availability is measured as a binary variable coded as  1  when the medicine is in the facility on the day of the survey and coded as  0  otherwise. This approach is currently used in the HAI/WHO methodology.Affordability is computed following these steps:3.1 Compute daily price per dose of treatment for each medicine (price per DDD) in the selected basket of medicines WHO treatment guidelines provide the needed information to compute DDD. DDD of a medicine is defined using the following formula:where:Units per treatments are tablets/vials or other forms that are needed for an individual with the average severity of the disease per one course of treatment of a duration of one month (365 days per year / 12 months per year = 30.42 days given 30 or 31 day per month), andMedicine prices are calculated per unit (per tablet/vial/other form) requiring adjustments for gram or milligram according to the potency. This ratio varies between  0  and infinity and is measured in local currency units per day [LCU/d].Information on the number of units per treatment is specified in Annex 3. The price per DDD can be measured in per day or per month. 3.2 Define National poverty line (NPL) and minimum wage of the LPGW for the analysed countryNational poverty line (NLP): countries periodically recalculate and update their poverty lines based on new survey data and publish this information in their national reports on poverty. To adjust the latest available NPLs to the relevant year of analysis (when needed) information on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the analysed country has to be used to account for deflation/inflation. National poverty reports consistently provide information on the NPLs in local currency units but often refer to different recall periods from country to country (NPL can be measured per day, per month or per year). For consistency, NPL has to be adjusted to be measured per day [LCU/d].The wage of the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW): is estimated and published in the ILOSTAT database. For countries with the latest available data collected in a year different from the year of analysis, LPGW wage is actualised using the CPI conversion factor. ILO provides information on the minimum LPGW wages in local currency units per month. LPGW wage has to be adjusted to be measured per day as well [LCU/d].The NPL and LPGW wage can be measured in per day or per month.3.3 Compute extra daily wages (EDW) First, the LPGW wage is compared to the NPL and if it is lower, medicine is considered unaffordable. In this case, only medicines with a price equal to zero will be considered affordable. Next, the affordability is measured via the number of extra daily wages (EDW) that are needed for the LPGW to pay for one-month course of treatment using the formula below. In particular, the number of extra daily wages can be computed using the following formula:3.4 Transform EDW variable into a binary formatFollowing the definition, medicine is considered to be affordable when the sum of NPL and price of a daily dose of the treatment is equal to or less than the minimum daily wage of the LPGW:Hence, the affordability of medicines is also measured as a binary variable that is coded as  1  when the medicine is affordable and  0  otherwise.When the price of the medicine is 0, there is no need for the above-mentioned computations and the medicine is considered affordable (i.e.  1 ). If all medicines in the country are provided free of charge, all medicines are directly marked as affordable and further computation of the index depends on the availability of these medicines.Step 4: Combine the two dimensions on availability and affordability (access to medicines)In this step, the two dimensions of access to medicines (availability and affordability) are combined into a multidimensional index. The construction of a multidimensional index is based on the union identification approach proposed by S. Alkire and G. Robles.The combination of the dimensions of medicines can be built in matrix form: This matrix contains performance for n objects of analysis (specified in rows) in d dimensions (specified in columns). The performance of any object  in all  dimensions is represented by the d-dimensional vector  for all  . The performance in any dimension  for all  objects are represented by the n-dimensional vector  for all . Overall, an index should be computed via two main steps: identification and aggregation. An example of how to combine the 2 dimensions can be found in Annex 4.Step 5: Apply weights to the medicine in the basket according to the regional prevalence of the diseases that are cured/treated/controlled by these medicinesAfter identifying the access variable, medicines in the basket have to be weighted according to the prevalence of the disease(s) that these medicines are used to cure/treat/control using the weights identified in step 2 and provided in Annex 2, tables 2.1 and 2.2. This is performed by multiplying the access variable with the medicine weights:  Figure 1. Achievement matrix of weighted access to medicineStep 6: Identify whether a facility has a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordableThe following computations must be undertaken in this step: 6.1 Calculate proportion of medicines that are accessible (both available and affordable) in each facilityBecause medicines are weighted, the proportion is computed as a weighted sum of medicines that are both available and affordable (accessible) in each facility using the following formula: This variable is then transformed into a percentage and varies from 0 to 100. The computed number of accessible medicines accounts for the importance of the analysed medicines in the country. In particular, if a medicine with a higher weight (for example hypertension) is not accessible, the index will be sensitive to this and will demonstrate the lack of access. On the contrary, if a medicine has a low weight (i.e. approaching zero, such as antimalarial medication in a non-endemic country) and is not accessible, the index will not be affected. 6.2 Mark facilities that have 80% or more of available and affordable medicines  The computed variable  access  is then transformed into the binary format identifying facilities that have the core basket of essential medicines available and affordable versus facilities that do not. A threshold of 80% is applied in order to transform the  access  variable into a binary format. In particular, at least 80% of all the medicines surveyed in a facility have to be both available and affordable. The transformation is made using the following formula:This threshold is agreed upon and adopted by the WHO Global Action Plan on Non-Communicable Diseases and used as a reference in this proposed methodology.  Step 7: Calculate the indicator as the proportion of facilities with accessible medicines in the countryThe proportion of facilities that have reached the 80% threshold is calculated out of the total number of surveyed facilities in a selected country using the following formula:The computed indicator is a proportion that will then be converted into a percentage between 0-100%.Step 8: Consideration of quality of the accessible medicines in the country using a proxy The country level of medicine regulatory capacity assessed using the WHO NRA GBT is used as a proxy of the quality of the accessible medicines. The countries with a WHO Listed Authority (WLA corresponding to maturity level 3 and above) will be flagged to indicate the assured quality component. How to define a minimum wage?

Basket of core set of relevant essential medicines for primary health care* These additional medicines were suggested for monitoring during the consultations with WHO regional advisers and WHO Member States, however they do not represent major burden of disease in countries and cannot be weighted according to the same procedure as the mandatory list. Table 2. Diseases treated with the medicines in the core listAnnex 2. Calculation of weightsWeights are region-specific, and the sum of the weights assigned to medicines in the basket is always equal to  1  in a given region. Since some of the medicines are weighted not according to the DALYs but according to the formula in points iii. and iv. above, the weights have to be normalized so that their sum is equal to  1 .WHO regional data on disease burden is computed and published for 5-year intervals (e.g. 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 for now). As a result, for data points falling between the reference years for which DALY estimates are available the closest reference year is used to calculate medicines' weights (either previous or following) (Figure 1). Figure 2.1. Selection of data year for computing medicine weightsTwo versions of weights are computed: one capturing 32 medicines (excluding optional medicines) and the other capturing 36 medicines (including optional medicines). For countries where the distribution of specific medicines is calculated only in specialized facilities (for example injectable medicines are provided only in hospitals), WHO suggests computing two versions of weights (1 – for pharmacies and other non-tertiary health care facilities based on a shorter list of medicines that exclude the mentioned medicines and 2 – for hospitals that includes the full list of medicines).Table 2.1: Region specific weights applied for medicines in a defied basket [excluding suggested for monitoring (optional) medicines]*	          Weights for 32 medicines are computed. Where several medicines or combinations of medicines are specified (listed with  OR ), one medicine has to be selected for the further computation of the SDG indicator. Table 2.2: Region specific weights applied for medicines in a defied basket [including suggested for monitoring (optional) medicines]  *Weights for 36 medicines are computed. Where several medicines or combinations of medicines are specified (listed with  OR ), one medicine has to be selected for the further computation of the SDG indicator.Annex 3: Basket of core set of relevant essential medicines for primary health care: number of units and duration per treatment
Annex 4 – Combination of availability and affordabilityAs an example, consider a simplified case of access to a basket of three medicines (Figure 2). In the matrix: 1  indicates that a medicine is available or is affordable.  0  indicates that a medicine is not available or not affordable. In other words,  0  in the matrix indicates that the dimension is deprived.  .  indicates cases when medicine is not available and consequently affordability of medicine is not measured. In other words, information on prices cannot be collected when a medicine is not found by the interviewer in the facility. Figure 4.1. Achievement matrix on access to medicine (two dimensions)In this basket the 1st medicine is fully accessible (i.e. it is both available and affordable), the 2nd medicine is partially accessible (i.e. it is available but not affordable), while the 3rd medicine is inaccessible (i.e. it is not available and thus it is not possible to collect information on prices).In this example, the first medicine is accessible and the third medicine is not. However, the second medicine is partially deprived indicating that specific policies applied in the country may be effective for availability of the medicine but not for its affordability. Applying the union identification approach by S. Alkire and G. Robles that treats elements (medicines) in the matrix with partial deprivation as fully deprived, the second medicine is considered not accessible as well (Figure 3). Figure 4.2. Achievement matrix of access to medicine (two dimensions & deprivation of dimensions)At the end of this step, the variable  access  to medicines is generated, combining the 2 dimensions of availability and affordability. This variable remains binary in nature with 1 – medicine is accessible (both available and affordable) and 0 – medicine is not accessible (not available or available but not affordable)."

Comments and limitations:Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public health sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military, nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. In many cases, information maintained at the national regulatory bodies and professional councils are not updated. As data is not always published annually for each country, the latest available data has been used. Due to the differences in data sources, considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage, periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data.

Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members .  Data presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in a day. Weekly data is averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated by dividing the daily average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work by 24 hours. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work () is calculated as:whereIf data on time spent are weekly, data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain daily time spent.Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. SDG indicator 5.4.1 is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both.

Indicator 5.6.2 measures only the existence of laws and regulations; it does not measure their implementation.  The indicator measures specific legal enablers and barriers for 13 components across four thematic areas. The calculation of the indicator requires data for all 13 components, then computation of the total score from those values.  The 13 components are placed on the same scale, with 0% being the lowest value and 100% being the most optimal value. Each component is scored independently and weighted equally.  The score for a given component is calculated as:((Number of enablers that exist / Total number of enablers) – (Number of barriers that exist / Total number of barriers)) *100The details of the scoring approach as it relates to each individual component can be assessed . The total score for Indicator 5.6.2 is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the 13 component scores. Similarly, the score for each thematic section is calculated as the arithmetic mean of its constituent component scores.  The scoring will be evaluated for any subtleties in the relative weight of enablers to barriers once data have been collected and scored for at least 50 countries.  "
Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,"Target 5.a: Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws","Indicator 5.a.1: (a) Proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure","The indicator is divided in two sub-indicators. Sub-indicator (a) is a prevalence measure. It measures the prevalence of people in the agricultural population with ownership or tenure rights over agricultural land, disaggregated by sex.Sub-indicator (b) focusses on the gender parity, measuring the extent to which women are disadvantaged in ownership / tenure rights over agricultural land. Agricultural land: In compliance with the classification proposed by the World Census of Agriculture 2020 (WCA 2020), land is considered 'agricultural land' according to its use. Moreover, a reference period is usually required in order to characterize the use of a specific area of agricultural land and identify subcategories.As clearly shown in the figure below, agricultural land is a subset of the total land.Classification of land use (WCA 2020)In particular, following the WCA 2020, agricultural land includes:land under temporary cropsland under temporary meadows and pasturesland temporarily fallowland under permanent cropsland under permanent meadows and pasturesIt excludes:land under farm buildings and farmyardsforest and other wooded landarea used for aquaculture (including inland and coastal waters if part of the holding)other area not elsewhere classifiedSince the indicator 5.a.1 focuses on agricultural land, it excludes all the forms of land that are not considered 'agricultural', including land under farm buildings and farmyards.Agricultural population:Indicator 5.a.1 uses 'agricultural population' as denominator, instead of the total population, because tenure rights over agricultural land are relevant especially for individuals whose livelihood relies on agriculture. As a consequence, in the context of 5.a.1, the term 'agricultural population' has to be interpreted as equivalent of 'individuals engaged in agriculture'.Although an official definition of 'agricultural population' does not exist, an operational definition of this term shall be proposed for the scope of indicator 5.a.1. Investigating involvement in agriculture is not trivial, because:Agricultural work is highly irregular and strongly affected by seasonality, therefore if the survey questions adopt a short recall period, we risk excluding individuals engaged in agriculture because they did not practice agriculture at the time of the survey or simply because they were interviewed off-season.Agricultural work may take a lot of individual's time – so be the main activity – but not necessarily be the main source of incomeAgriculture is sometimes practiced only or mainly for self-consumption, without any market orientation (so, with no or little income) and therefore not necessarily perceived an economic activity.Finally, the individual's livelihood cannot be completely detached from the livelihood of the other household members, thus the necessity of a household-level perspective.In view of this, in the context of the indicator 5.a.1, an individual is part of 'adult agricultural population' if the following conditions are met: is adults/he belongs to a household where at least one member is mainly engaged in an agricultural work over the past 12 months, regardless the final purpose (whether for income-generation or self-consumption) and the status in employment. The adoption of a household perspective is particularly important from the gender perspective, because in many agricultural households, women often consider themselves as 'not involved in agriculture' whereas they provide substantive support to the household's agricultural activities.Ownership and tenure rights over agricultural land:It is challenging to define and to operationalize ownership and tenure rights in a way that provides reliable and comparable figures across countries.Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to a freehold tenure. However, in systems where land is owned by the State, the term 'land ownership' refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system – for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the State, often for several decades, and that are transferrable. In this context, it is more appropriate to speak of tenure rights.Nonetheless, as emphasized by the EDGE (Evidence and Data for Gender Equality) project, focusing on legally recognized documents is not sufficient to analyse the complexity of rights related to land, especially in developing countries and from the gender perspective. The main factor limiting the universal applicability of legally recognized documents is the diverse penetration of such legally binding documents. Considering the above, as well as the need to propose an indicator valid at global level, the indicator 5.a.1 relies on the three conditions (proxies): 1) Presence of legally recognised documents in the name of the individual; 2) right to sell; 3) right to bequeath. 1) Presence of legally recognised documents in the name of the individualIt refers to the existence of any document an individual can use to claim property rights before the law over an asset by virtue of the individual's name being listed as owner or holder on the document. Given the differences between legal systems across countries it is not possible to clearly define an exhaustive list of documents that could be considered a proof of tenure security. However, depending on the national legal framework the following documents may be considered as formal titles:Title deed:  a written or printed instrument that effects a legal disposition Certificate of occupancy or land certificate  A land certificate is a certified copy of an entry in a land title system and provides proof of the ownership and of encumbrances on the land at that time Purchase agreement: a contract between a seller and a buyer to dispose of landRegistered certificate of hereditary acquisitionCertificate of customary tenure: an official state document indicating the owner or holder of the land because customary law has recognized that particular person as the rightful owner. It can be used as proof of legal right over the land. These certificates include, among others, certificates of customary ownership and customary use.Registered certificate of perpetual / long term lease:  a contractual agreement between a landlord and a tenant for the tenancy of land. A lease or tenancy agreement is the contractual document used to create a leasehold interest or tenancy Registered short term (less than 3 years) rental contractCertificate issued for adverse possession or prescription: is a certificate indicating that the adverse possessor acquires the land after a prescribed statutory period.  In order to overcome the lack of written documentation and to generate a globally valid indicator it becomes crucial to take into account also the alienation rights over land, which can be present even in contexts where tenure rights are not documented. Alienation is defined as the ability to transfer a given asset during lifetime or after death. The right to sell and to bequeath are considered as objective facts that carry legal force as opposed to a simple self-reported declaration of tenure rights over land. In particular:2) Right to sellIt refers to the ability of an individual to permanently transfer the asset in question in return for cash or in-kind benefits. 3) Right to bequeathIt refers to the ability of an individual to pass on the asset in question to another person(s) after his or her death, by written will, oral will (if recognized by the country) or when the deceased left no will, through intestate succession. The decision to rely on the three proxies above (availability of a legal document, right to sell, right to bequeath) is justified by the results of the seven field tests conducted under the framework on the EDGE project. In particular, the tests demonstrated: The lack of reliability of reported ownership/possession. In fact reported ownership/possession was often neither supported by any kind of documentation nor by the possession of any alienation right. The need to consider as 'owners' or 'holders of tenure rights' only the individuals who are linked to the agricultural land by an objective right over it, including both formal legal possession and alienation rights. The need to combine different proxies, as no single proxy is universally valid. How the indicator is calculated:The indicator 5.a.1 considers as owners or holders of tenure rights all the individuals in the reference population (agricultural population) who:Are listed as 'owners' or 'holders' on a certificate that testifies security of tenure over agricultural landORHave the right to sell agricultural landORHave the right to bequeath agricultural landThe presence of one of the three proxies is sufficient to define a person as 'owner' or 'holder' of tenure rights over agricultural land. The advantage of this approach is its applicability to different countries. Indeed, based on the analysis of the seven EDGE pilot countries, these proxies provide the most robust measure of ownership/tenure rights that is comparable across countries with diverse prevalence of documentation. In fact, individuals may still have the right to sell or bequeath an asset in the absence of legally recognized document, therefore the indicator combines documented ownership / tenure rights with the right to sell or bequeath to render it comparable across countries.Operationalization of indicator 5.a.1 expressed through mathematical formulas are the following: Sub-indicator (a) Sub-indicator (b) "
Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,"Target 5.a: Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws",Indicator 5.a.2: Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women's equal rights to land ownership and/or control,"Indicator 5.a.2 looks at the extent to which the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women's equal rights to land ownership and/or control. The indicator  measures  the level to which a country's legal framework supports women's land rights, by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices , in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food Security (CFS) members in 2012.The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the following:Proxy A:  Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentivesProxy B:  Compulsory spousal consent for land transactionsProxy C: Women's and girls' equal inheritance rightsProxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women's ownership and control over landProxy E: In legal systems that recognise customary land tenure, existence of explicit protection of the land rights of womenProxy F: Mandatory quotas for women's participation in land management and administration institutionsThe qualitative and legal nature of this indicator required the development of nuanced and articulated methodology that could be feasible, universally relevant and meaningful. The computation of results under Indicator 5.a.2 involves three different steps: (1) assignments of a  stage of incorporation  for each proxy, (2) classification of country according the number of proxies located in primary or primary and secondary legislation and (3) consolidation of all country results for global reporting.Step 1: Assignment of stage of incorporation for each proxyCountries collect the information for each of the six proxies and then is computed by stage of incorporation in the policy and legal framework, using a scale from 0 to 3.Each number refers to the stage of incorporation of the proxy into the policy and legal framework, as laid out hereunder.Stage 0: Proxy is absent / could not be located in the legal and policy framework.Stage 1: A policy is in place, incorporating the proxy.Stage 2: Primary legislation includes the proxyStage 3: Secondary legislation contains the proxyNon-Applicable (NA): The proxy does not apply to the countryNB 1: The assessment of indicator 5.a.2 as mentioned above, also involves analysing policies because policies are foundations for laws and signal important progress towards incorporating the proxies in primary and/or secondary law. However, for the results regarding the policies will not be included in the global SDG assessment results. Only what it is found in binding instruments that is in primary legislation (stage 2) and/or secondary legislation (stage 3) will be computed.  Step 2: Classification categories of country The country will then be classified according to the total number of proxies found in primary legislation or primary and secondary legislation. Given that not in all countries customary land tenure rules exist or customary law is recognised (related to proxy E), for the purpose of computation a two-scale (or dual) approach has been developed: For countries where customary land tenure is NOT recognised in the legal framework (either via statute or the constitution), regardless of whether it exists de facto or not, Proxy E is marked non-applicable and the country will be assessed out of the five remaining proxies. For countries where customary land tenure is recognised in the legal framework, the country will be assessed against all six proxies,The table below describes the dual approach classification and the classification bands. As is shown below, in countries where customary law is applicable (Proxy E) the presence of five or six proxies are included in the same band (band 6 - very high levels of guarantees). This is due to the necessity of making universal the calculation of the component of customary law - a component of the indicator which in itself is not universal to all countries.Table 1: Classification categoriesUnder the methodology all proxies have an equal weight. This implies that no dimension is more important than another in terms of supporting gender equality in land ownership and/or control. "

For example, a government program that provides scholarships for girls only, or a prenatal care program, or a National Action Plan on Gender Equality; orPrograms or policies that target both women or girls and men or boys and have gender equality as the primary objective. For example, a national public information campaign against gender violence, or on-the-job training programs on gender equality; orPrograms or policies where gender equality is not the primary objective but the program includes action to close gender gaps. These programs could include provision of infrastructure, public services and social protection. For example, an infrastructure program that has a provision for using women labour, or a public transportation program that takes into consideration the mobility needs of women in its design.  Programs or policies have adequate resources allocated within the budget, sufficient to meet both their general objectives and their gender equality goals  can be defined as:The programs or policies that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals are allocated sufficient resources to cover the costs of meeting those goals from funding that is included in the budget rather than from off-budget sources. Procedures in place to ensure that these resources are executed according to the budget  can be defined as:There are procedures established in laws or regulations so that resources for programs or policies that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals are executed as specified in the budget or if there are deviations in the exercise from the budgeted allocations, government agencies must justify to a supervising entity (e.g. ministries of finance, parliaments, audit bodies, or other relevant authorities) the reason for not executing resources according to budget.For Criterion 2: Call circulars  can be defined as:Call circulars are the official notices that are issued by the Ministry of Finance or Budget Office in a country towards the beginning of each annual budget cycle. The circular instructs government agencies how they must submit their bids or demands for budget allocations for the coming year (in some countries the notice may have another name, such as budget guidelines or Treasury guidelines). It may inform each agency what its budget  ceiling  for the next fiscal year. Key programs and policies  can be defined as:Programs or policies of the government, that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals (as identified in Criterion 1). Ex-ante gender impact assessment  can be defined as:Assessing individual resource allocations, in advance of their inclusion in the budget, specifically for their impact on gender equality. For example, before its inclusion in the budget, there is an estimate of how a conditional cash transfer program will impact school attendance of girls. Sex-disaggregated statistics and data are available in a systematic manner across all key programs and policies  can be defined as:There is routine availability of gender-specific data sets and statistics that would greatly facilitate the evidential basis for the identification of gender equality gaps, design of policy interventions, and the evaluation of impacts. Gender budget statements  can be defined as:A document that, either as part of the budget documentation or separately, provides a clear statement of gender-related goals. It is a document produced by a government agency, usually the Ministry of Finance or Budget Office, to show what its programs and budgets are doing in respect of gender. It is generally prepared after government agencies have completed the process of drawing up the budget and allocating resources to different programs in response to the annual call circular. Functional classifiers  can be defined as:Categorization of expenditure according to the purposes and objectives for which they are intended. A functional classifier on gender would identify expenditure that goes to programs or activities that address gender issues. Ex-post gender impact assessment  can be defined as: Assessing individual resource allocations, after their implementation, specifically for their impact on gender equality. For example, once the resources are spent and the program executed, how did a conditional cash transfer program affected the school attendance rate of girls as when compared to boys' attendance rate? The budget as a whole is subject to independent audit, to assess the extent to which it promotes gender-responsive policies  can be defined as:Independent, objective analysis, conducted by a competent authority different from the central budget authority, of the extent to which gender equality is effectively promoted and/or attained through the policies set out in the annual budget.For Criterion 3: Published in an accessible manner  can be defined as:Allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment are published on the Ministry of Finance (or office responsible for budget) website and/or related official bulletins or public notices in a way that is clearly signalled and/or made available in hard copies that are distributed to parliamentarians and NGOs. Published in a timely manner  can be defined as:Allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment and/or its exercise are published in the same quarter as when approved/exercised.Comments and limitations:The indicator does not measure allocation of resources but the existence of mechanisms to track resource allocations and that make that information available publicly. However, there is an optional question in the questionnaire (not scored) that requests countries to report the percentage of the government budget allocated for gender equality programs. Another limitation is that the indicator, which is process oriented, does not provide data on the adequacy or quality of resource allocations.MethodologyComputation Method:The method of computation is as follows: Unit:%"

'Improved' drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, yard or plot; public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tubewells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; delivered water and rainwater.Household surveys and censuses currently provide information on types of basic drinking water sources listed above, and also indicate if sources are on premises. These data sources often have information on the availability of water and increasingly on the quality of water at the household level, through direct testing of drinking water for faecal or chemical contamination. These data will be combined with data on availability and compliance with drinking water quality standards (faecal and chemical) from administrative reporting or regulatory bodies. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) estimates access to basic services for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression line to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses.

That is due to the fact that, for the agricultural sector, only the value produced under irrigation has to be counted in calculating the indicator. Hence, the sum of the value added of the various sectors used in these formulas is not equivalent to the total GDP of the country."

All variables are expressed in km3/year (109 m3/year).Stress (%) = TWW / (TRWR - Env.) * 100It is proposed to classify the level of water stress in three main categories (levels): low, high and very high. The thresholds for the indicator could be country specific, to reflect differences in climate and national water management objectives. Alternatively, uniform thresholds could be proposed using existing literature and taking into account environmental water requirements."

The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as  a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.

Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,"Target 6.5: By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate",Indicator 6.5.2: Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation,"The proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation is defined as the proportion of transboundary basins area within a country with an operational arrangement for water cooperation. It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those transboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. 'transboundary' basins) that are covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in a country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain it expressed as percentage share.Step 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifersWhile the identification of transboundary surface water is straightforward, the identification of transboundary aquifers requires investigations.If there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable.Step 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sumCommonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and the basin area is known or easily measurable. The total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each of the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of systems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary aquifers, even if located within a transboundary river basin, should be added to be able to track progress of cooperation on transboundary aquifers. The calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, with appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be used to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement exists on either one).Step 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify which transboundary waters are covered by a cooperation arrangementSome operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary waters in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is used to calculate the indicator value.In other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the watercourse and in such cases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational arrangement for calculating the indicator value. At the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by cooperation arrangements (and their respective areas). Step 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management are operationalThe following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin or in relation to a particular co-riparian country is operational:- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation - regularity of formal communication in form of meetings - existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives - regular exchange of information and data If any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot be considered operational. This information is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin reporting systems.Step 5 Calculate the indicator value, that is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of those transboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation arrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins (including aquifers), multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share."""

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: •	Sub-Indicator 1 – spatial extent of water-related ecosystems •	Sub-Indicator 2 – water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:•	Sub-Indicator 3 – quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries•	Sub-Indicator 4 – water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 •	Sub-Indicator 5 – quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled,  Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1 .The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.  Sub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Sub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:"
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,"Target 6.a: By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies",Indicator 6.a.1: Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan,"Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan is defined as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) disbursements that are included in the government budget.The indicator is computed as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related ODA that is included in the government budget, i.e. the amount of water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget divided by the total amount of water and sanitation-related ODA.The numerator on water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget will be obtained from the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. The question on external funding collects data on the amount of donor funds that were included in government budget. Data for 2015 ODA disbursements through GLAAS will be available by end-2016. The scope of the question on external funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 cycle to address all targets under SDG 6, including wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and water-related ecosystems.The denominator on total water and sanitation-related ODA disbursements will be obtained through OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) (purpose codes 14000-series for the water sector and purpose code 31140 for agricultural water resources). Data on ODA disbursements for 2015 will be made available through CRS in December 2016."
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,Target 6.b: Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management,Indicator 6.b.1: Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management,"The indicator assesses the percentage of local administrative units (as defined by the national government) that have an established and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management.The indicator Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is currently being measured by the Proportion of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or policy for participation by service users/communities in planning program in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion and the Proportion of countries with high level of users/communities participating in planning programs in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion.The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) questionnaire provides information on whether there are  clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users (e.g. households) and communities in planning programs . For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle.Treatment of missing values:At country levelDue to the highly country- and context-specific nature of the indicator, no estimates are produced for countries that are missing data.At regional and global levelsOperational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to water and sanitation management then the country will be excluded from the regional and global estimates for this indicator. Global and regional estimates for a related indicator on the presence and use of participation policies and procedures at the national level for different water subsectors are also derived to support the target indicator. Similarly, countries with missing values are excluded from global and regional analysis for this indicator.Regional aggregates:For global and regional aggregates, the percentage of local administrative units that have a defined and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management will be averaged among countries, with each country's percent value weighted based on total country population for the data year, as a proportion of the global population.Sources of discrepancies:This indicator will be generated by countries, thus no differences in global and national figures are expected.Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:National governments participating in GLAAS fill out the country survey, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. GLAAS survey documents for the current cycle can be found at the following link:   The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO and has completed three full cycles (2009/2010, 2011/2012, and 2013/2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. GLAAS survey documents for the current cycle of data collection (2016/2017) can be found at the following link: Quality assurance:Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts. Quality of the submission is also assessed through an analysis of data collected on country processes (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.) as well as supporting documentation provided. In addition, an external validation with key informants is conducted, in which WASH experts who have not participated in the GLAAS process respond to selected questions from the survey for a specific country within their area of expertise, and agreement with country responses is evaluated.Data submitted through GLAAS are endorsed by the national government prior to submission. A form () providing consent to WHO for the release and publication of the country data is signed and submitted along with the filled survey."
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,"Target: 6.3 By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.",Indicator: 6.3.2 Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality,"The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage.  The indicator is computed by first classifying all assessed water bodies based on the compliance of the monitoring data collected for selected parameters at monitoring locations within the water body with parameter-specific target values: Where is the percentage compliance [%]; is the number of monitoring values in compliance with the target values; is the total number of monitoring values.A threshold value of 80% compliance is defined to classify water bodies as  good  quality. Thus, a body of water is classified as having a good quality status if at least 80% of all monitoring data from all monitoring stations within the water body are in compliance with the respective targets.In a second step, the classification results are used to compute the indicator as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having a good quality status to the total number of classified water bodies expressed in percentage:Where is the percentage of water bodies classified as having a good quality status; is the number of classified water bodies classified as having a good quality status; is the total number of monitored and classified water bodies."
"Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all","Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services",Indicator 7.1.1: Proportion of population with access to electricity,"Proportion of population with access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to electricity.Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modelling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2012. This modelling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) referenced below provides more details on the suggested methodology for tracking access to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87)."
"Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all","Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services",Indicator 7.1.2: Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology,"Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage.  Clean  is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion.The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about 800 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys.Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel model. The model only accounts for regions, countries and time as a spline function, and estimates are restricted to values ranging from zero to one. More details on the model are published elsewhere (Bonjour et al, 2013).Estimates for countries with no available surveys were obtained as follows:When survey data is available for a country, the regional population- weighted mean is used to derive aggregate estimates at a regional or global level, however no country point estimate is given for that country is reportedCountries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,746.- per capita are assumed to have made a complete transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic energy source for cooking and the primary reliance on polluting (unclean) fuels and technologies use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed as zero for regional and global estimates.For estimating the fraction of the population relying on clean fuels and technologies for heating and lighting, the same methodology using survey data to derive country estimates for a particular year will be used using the same above mentioned assumptions."
"Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all","Target 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix",Indicator 7.2.1: Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption,"The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources.This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources – statistics used to produce a national energy balance. Internationally agreed methodologies for energy statistics are described in the  International Recommendations on Energy Statistics  (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, available at: .Once a national energy balance is developed, the indicator can be calculated by dividing final energy consumption from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively. For instance, if total final consumption table reports 150 TJ for biogas energy, while total final consumption of electricity is 400 TJ and heat 100 TJ, and the share of biogas in total electricity output is 10 percent and 5 percent in heat, the total reported number for biogas consumption will be 195 TJ (150 TJ+400TJ*10%+100TJ*5%). The Global Tracking Framework Report (IEA and World Bank, 2013) provides more details on the suggested methodology for defining and measuring renewable energy (Chapter 4, Section 1, page 201-202). UNSD follows the same methodology to compute the indicators, though information may come from different tables."

It is a measure of the risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury based on the duration of exposure to adverse work-related factors.The incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries provide information on the number of cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury per workers in the reference group during the reference period. It is a measure of the personal likelihood of the workers in the reference group of suffering from work-related injuries.For the purposes of international reporting on the SDG indicators, incidence rates are used, even though the indicator title of 8.8.1 calls for the use of frequency rates, as common practices around the world and data availability favour incidence rates.().Occupational accident: an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer.Occupational injury: any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. An occupational injury can be fatal or non-fatal (and non-fatal injuries could entail the loss of work days).Fatal occupational injury: an occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident.Case of occupational injury: the case of one worker incurring one or more occupational injuries as a result of one occupational accident. Workers in the reference group: workers in the reference group refer to the average number of workers in the particular group under consideration and who are covered by the source of the statistics on occupational injuries (for example, those of a specific sex or in a specific economic activity, occupation, region, age group, or any combination of these, or those covered by a particular insurance scheme, accident notification systems, or household or establishment survey).Comments and limitations:There may be problems of under reporting of occupational injuries, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality. Under reporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of development, but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data users should be aware of this issue when analysing the data.Double-counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics.Because data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyse indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed.
MethodologyComputation Method:The frequency and incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries will be calculated separately, since statistics on fatal injuries tend to come from a different source than those on non-fatal injuries, which would make their sum into total occupational accidents inaccurate.The fatal occupational injury frequency rate is expressed per 1'000'000 hours worked by the workers in the reference group. Thus, it is calculated as follows:Similarly, the non-fatal occupational injury frequency rate is calculated as follows:Ideally, the denominator should be the number of hours actually worked by workers in the reference group. When this is not possible, the denominator can be calculated on the basis of normal hours of work taking into account entitlements to periods of paid absence from work, such as paid vacations, paid sick leave and public holidays.If the data needed to calculate frequency rates is not available, incidence rates may be calculated instead. Indeed, incidence rates are used for the purposes of international reporting on this indicator rather than frequency rates.The fatal occupational injury incidence rate is expressed per 100'000 workers in the reference group, and thus, is calculated as follows:Similarly, the non-fatal occupational injury incidence rate is calculated as follows:In calculating the average number of workers, the number of part-time workers should be converted to full-time equivalents. For the calculation of rates, the numerator and the denominator should have the same coverage. For example, if self-employed persons are not covered by the source of statistics on fatal occupational injuries, they should also be taken out of the denominator.

"Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all","Target 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment","Indicator 8.8.2: Level of national compliance with labour rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining) based on International Labour Organization (ILO) textual sources and national legislation, by sex and migrant status","The indicator will cover all ILO member states seeking to measure the level of national compliance with fundamental rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining, FACB) based on six international ILO supervisory body textual sources and also on national legislation. It is based on a coding process starting from coding the sources relevant to the year evaluated, coding the non-compliance identified in the collected sources and by converting the coding into indicators. Transparency. A key rationale for the large number of evaluation criteria is to eliminate catchall evaluation criteria for violations of FACB rights not elsewhere coded, that is, violations for which there are no explicit evaluation criteria. More generally, the aim was to avoid pigeon-holing violations that are not of similar character or severity. This level of detail also facilitates the transparency of the method, in that very specific violations can be readily traced back to individual textual sources. This is made possible by the coding itself, in which violations are coded with the letters  a  through  g,  with each letter standing for one of the seven textual sources coded, as discussed below. Inter-coder reliability. The method is based on clear and comprehensive coding rules as well as definitions for each of the evaluation criteria with the aim of making the indicators reproducible. Inter-coder reliability was assessed in the process of training teams of lawyers (sequentially and independently of each other) to do the coding and in double-checking their coding, which resulted in a number of clarifications and refinements to the coding rules and definitions. This process led to the conclusion that the inter-coder reliability of the method depends first and foremost on the coders being sufficiently well-trained and in particular being sufficiently well-versed in the coding rules and definitions to be able to apply them consistently. MethodologyComputation Method:Table 1 enumerates the evaluation criteria for workers and their organizations and Table 2 the evaluation criteria for employers and their organizations. As shown in these tables, the evaluation criteria are grouped into broad categories represented by Roman numerals, which are themselves split into violations of FACB rights in law and in practice. In other words, most of the evaluation criteria representing violations in law have a partner representing violations in practice, and vice versa. Violations in law refer to national legislation that is not in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO as well as to actions taken on the basis of such legislation.Violations in practice refer to acts committed and in violation of the existing national legislation that is in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO.The rough doubling of evaluation criteria by splitting them into violations in law and in practice makes their sizeable number more tractable for coders. Such branching relationships among the evaluation criteria extend to two additional types of evaluation criteria addressing  Lack of guarantee of due process and/or justice  and  Violations committed against trade union officials  and  Violations committed against officials of employers' organizations . The evaluation criteria  Lack of guarantee of due process and/or justice  are incorporated into the main categories of evaluation criteria as the last-listed evaluation criteria within each, with the exception of category on  Fundamental civil liberties in practice . This is based on the premise that the exercise of FACB rights depends on their effective protection defined in terms of fair and sufficiently prompt trials by an independent and impartial judiciary. Under the category of  Fundamental civil liberties in practice,  on the other hand, these evaluation criteria are attached to each of the six more specific evaluation criteria. This emphasis on fundamental civil liberties in practice is meant to reflect the emphasis of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA), in particular their view that a free and independent movement of workers and employers (and their organizations) can develop only to the extent that fundamental human rights are respected and where in the event of violations, measures are taken to identify, bring to trial and convict the guilty parties (ILO, 2006, Paras. 33 and 51). In addition, these criteria are attached to  Anti-union discriminatory measures  and  Acts of interference of employers and/or public authorities  and  Acts of interference of workers' organizations and/or public authorities  under the category of  Right to establish and join organizations in practice , motivated by Article 3 of ILO Convention 98 which states that  Machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established, where necessary, for the purpose of ensuring respect for the right to organise... .The evaluation criteria  Violations committed against trade union officials  and  Violations committed against officials of employers' organizations  are attached to the specific evaluation criteria under the category of  Fundamental civil liberties in practice  (the case of 'excessive prohibitions/restriction in the event of state of emergency' does not apply here). In addition, this criterion is attached to  Anti-union discriminatory measures  under the category of  Right of workers to establish and join organizations in practice  as well as to  Use of excessive sanctions in case of legitimate and peaceful strikes  under the category of  Right to strike in practice . The emphasis on officials is motivated by the view that violations against them are particularly damaging to the exercise of FACB rights. In keeping with the definition for SDG indicator 8.8.2, while all violations of FACB rights based sex or migrant status will be coded and embodied in the indicator, the textual information on which this coding is based will also be made available in a separate document in an effort to highlight such violations.   Textual sourcesThe present method makes use of six ILO textual sources: Reports of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations; Reports of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards; Country Baselines Under the ILO Declaration Annual Review; Representations under Article 24 of the ILO Constitution; Complaints under Article 26 of the ILO Constitution and Report on the Committee on Freedom of Association.The method also codes relevant national legislation for non-ratifying countries. The coding of national legislation is particularly important to offset information asymmetries between ratifying and non-ratifying countries as regards FACB rights in law. Note that ratifying countries are defined as those that have ratified both Conventions 87 and 98, in which case its national legislation is not coded at present. Non-ratifying countries, on the other hand, fall into two categories, those that have ratified neither 87 nor 98 and those that have ratified only one of these Conventions. If a country has ratified only 87, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 98, as violations under 87 fall under the remit of the ILO's Committee of Experts as well as Committee on the Application of Standards. Similarly, if a country has ratified only 98, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 87. Note that for federal states, only federal-level legislation is coded. The seven textual sources are recapitulated in Table 3, along with the associated letters by which they are coded as well as whether these sources pertain to ratifying countries, non-ratifying countries, or both. Using the Delphi Method to Construct Evaluation Criteria WeightsThe application of the Delphi method involved two rounds of surveys conducted via email of internationally-recognized experts in labour law having knowledge of the ILO's supervisory system and particular knowledge of FACB rights as defined by the ILO. Regional representation was another consideration. Experts remained anonymous with respect to each other throughout the process. Initial invitations to participate were sent to 37 experts, of whom 18 initially agreed to participate and of whom 14 went through both survey rounds. Of these 14 experts, 13 were lawyers and one a political scientist, with five based in Western Europe, one in Eastern Europe, three in the US, two in Latin America, two in Asia and one in Africa.  Applying the weights, normalization and default scoresThe raw coding uses the letters  a  through  g  (again, with each letter corresponding to one of the seven textual sources) to represent coded violations of FACB rights for each evaluation criteria, yielding a column of 180 cells for any given country and year. In order to apply the weights, any cell containing one or more letters is assigned a value of 1 and any blank cell for which there are no coded violations is assigned a value of 0, creating a binary coding column. The number of letters in a cell does not affect the construction of the binary coding column, in order to avoid double-counting given that the textual sources commonly reference each other. The cells of the column of weights is then multiplied by corresponding cells of the binary coding column, and summing across the cells of the resultant column yields a weighted non-normalized score for any given country and year. A hypothetical example is provided in Table 4, showing only those evaluation criteria with coded violations. In this example, 24 evaluation criteria are coded. Applying the weights yields a non-normalized score of 42.3 and a normalized score of 4.5, based on the rules describe next. To normalize the indicators over time, weighted non-normalized scores were calculated for  the roughly one-third of countries having the most coded violations of FACB rights of workers and their organizations for the years 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2012. This is based on the number of violations of FACB rights of workers and their organizations because of their greater frequency of being reported in ILO textual sources. The highest weighted non-normalized score for several countries hovered around 80. As such, 95 is assigned as the maximum weighted non-normalized score for the overall LR indicator, roughly equal to one-half the hypothetically possible maximum weighted non-normalized score. On this basis, the non-normalized score for any given country and year is normalized to range in value from 0 to 10, the best and worst possible scores respectively. In the future, if any country should receive a non-normalized score of greater than 95, this will be capped at 95, yielding a normalized score of 10.In addition, the method applies the notion that general prohibitions in law imply general prohibitions in practice (though not vice versa). In terms of coding, this means that – both for workers and employers -the direct coding of  General prohibition of the right to establish and join organizations  in law automatically triggers the coding of  General prohibition of the development of independent organizations  in practice; the direct coding of  General prohibition of the right to collective bargaining  in law automatically triggers the coding of the  General prohibition of collective bargaining  in practice ; and, finally, for workers, the direct coding of  General prohibition of the right to strike  in law  automatically triggers the coding of the  General prohibition of strikes  in practice . Given that the general prohibition of the development of independent organizations implies the general prohibition of collective bargaining (though not vice versa), similar coding rules apply. In addition to the above normalization rules, the worst possible score of 10 is given for all-encompassing violations of FACB rights, that is, for  General prohibition of the right to establish and join organizations  in law,  General prohibition of the development of independent organizations  in practice,  General prohibition of the right to collective bargaining  in law, and  General prohibition of collective bargaining  in practice. The reporting of SDG indicator 8.8.2 will highlight differences between ratifying and non-ratifying countries by adding two columns alongside SDG indicator 8.8.2. The first column will indicate whether a country has ratified Convention No. 87 and the second column will indicate whether a county has ratified Convention No. 98. The columns will be explained with the following text:  SDG indicator 8.8.2 is not intended as a tool to compare compliance among ILO member States. It should specifically be noted that reporting obligations of an ILO member State to the ILO's supervisory system and thus ILO textual sources are different for ratifying and non-ratifying ILO member States. Consistent with Tables 1 and 2 above, issues of non-compliance with respect to evaluation criteria concerning the exclusion of workers and employers in EPZs from freedom of association and collective bargaining rights will not be coded separately but rather coded under evaluation criteria concerning the general exclusion of workers and employers.An additional evaluation criterion has been added to code cases brought under Article 26 of the ILO's Constitution before the ILO's Commission of Inquiry and given the maximum weight of 2.0 (evaluation criteria 0 in Tables 1 and 2). This evaluation criterion will be coded first for the year when the decision is made for the establishment of the procedure and then for every subsequent year until the final report is adopted and published.Based on the identification of violations in ILO supervisory body textual sources, violations related to the prohibition of employers' access to their premises during industrial action will be coded under new separate evaluation criteria that specifically address such violations (evaluation criteria 48 and 55 in Table 2 for violations in law and in practice, respectively).Regarding possible contradictions among textual sources, for the purposes of SDG indicator 8.8.2 the following coding rule will be applied:  If contradictory evidence is found within the same source or if an explicitly stated contradictory assessment is found among different sources – based solely on the comments, conclusions and recommendations of the ILO supervisory system – the information will be excluded from coding. The coding of national legislation will be done in close collaboration with the International Labour Office to assure that it is done in a manner consistent with the ILO's supervisory system. In addition, countries may also make available information on national legislation when reporting on this indicator through Voluntary National Reports or national reporting platforms or any other national reports. Note that in order to avoid creating an additional supervisory mechanism, coding of national legislation for ratifying member States will not be undertaken for SDG indicator 8.8.2 as this is under the remit of the ILO's supervisory system."

In calling for vigorous, collective action to address an aggravated youth employment crisis, this resolution advocates for a multi-pronged approach with policy measures that are context-specific and integrated, entailing strategies which bring together in a coherent manner a variety of instruments to increase the demand, enhance the supply and improve matching in youth labour markets.Recovering from the crisis: A Global Jobs Pact adopted by the ILC at its June 2009 session. Based on the ILO's Decent Work Agenda, the Global Jobs Pact presents an integrated portfolio of policies that puts employment and social protection at the centre of crisis response, recognising the critical role of participation and social dialogue.   ILO databases:International monitoring of youth employment policies was carried out over the period 2010-2012 by the Youth Employment Network (YEN) – a partnership between the ILO, United Nations and World Bank – utilising a questionnaire sent to national authorities. This evolved into YouthPOL, an inventory of youth employment policies and programmes maintained by the ILO (65 countries covered to date). The ILO also maintains EmPol, a dataset of broader national employment policies (143 countries covered).ILO expertise and experience:  The Department of Statistics (STATISTICS) works to provide relevant, timely and reliable labour statistics, to develop international standards for better measurement of labour issues and enhanced international comparability, and to help member States develop and improve their labour statistics. The Employment Policy Department (EMPLOYMENT) is responsible for promoting full and productive employment by developing integrated employment, development and skills policies (ILO, 2012) that are inclusive, gender sensitive and sustainable. The department is mandated to coordinate ILO efforts to promote decent job opportunities for young women and men; over the years, it has supported the formulation, implementation and review of national youth employment strategies and action plans in different countries and regions (ILO, 2008; ILO, 2015). This type of targeted action and related achievements have been included in the ILO programming framework and performance system. The ILO supports its constituents and other development stakeholders through knowledge and capacity building as well as through policy advocacy and advice. The list of references at the end of this note offers examples of recent major ILO contributions to knowledge building on youth employment and youth employment policy (ILO, 2017).  MethodologyComputation Method:The information and documents provided by national authorities will be analysed by the ILO by making use of the grid hereafter.   In all cases, the grid refers to a national strategy for youth employment as a distinct strategy or as part of a national employment strategy.Missing values (i.e. no response/unknown) should be noted as such. They should be omitted from the final global and regional breakdown: proportions should only be calculated on the basis of received responses. However, the global and regional response rates will be indicated.The possible development of metadata notes complementing the grid is being considered. Among other aspects, these notes may refer to the measures and provisions in place, and would also consider the involvement of national constituents in the development and operationalization of the strategies.    The ILO may also envisage to conduct a more detailed analysis of selected country documents for purposes which go beyond the scope of SDG monitoring, in order to gather insights on institutional and operational matters in national efforts for youth employment.The following steps are followed in developing the indicator methodology:  Examination of relevant policy instruments, including the above-mentioned Call for action and Global Jobs Pact. Adopted by ILO tripartite constituents, these documents provide a sound framework for defining SDG indicator 8.b.1.Review of ILO databases on employment and youth employment policies (EmPOL and YouthPOL), maintained by the Employment Policy Department. A methodology for defining, measuring and validating this indicator (the present document).Development of a survey instrument (questionnaire) to collect national-level information on youth employment policies from national entities. The information will be used to determine if countries have developed and operationalized a national strategy for youth employment as a stand-alone strategy or as part of a national employment or sectoral strategy, in line with the above-mentioned ILC resolutions.  Technical guidelines for data providers and compilers, along with the above-mentioned questionnaire and detailed notes.Pilot the methodology in selected countries.Consultations with pertinent ministries and social partners' representatives will take place throughout the process.The purpose of SDG indicator 8.b.1 is to provide an indication of the progress of countries in addressing youth employment issues. In this respect, it is assumed that having officially adopted what can be recognised as a structured strategy for youth employment would mean larger attention given by a country to youth labour market challenges, compared to countries with no strategy. In fact, the development of such a strategy usually entails broad participation of and consultation/coordination among different stakeholders.It should also be considered that governments may have de facto national strategies for youth employment, but lack an officially adopted de jure document. For SDG 8.b.1 monitoring purposes we'll only consider what emerges from de jure documents. "

Road Network Data – Data on road locations may come from a number of sources. Ideally government data are used, as they are consistent with the road network for which road agencies are responsible and are relatively easily merged with other operational databases. In countries where the road location data may not be detailed enough or entirely missing, alternative data sources may be available, such as the open source Open Street Map. Road Condition Data – The principle of the  all-season  road network remains central to the original concept of measuring the RAI.  An  all-season road  is defined as a road that is motorable all year round by the prevailing means of rural transport (often a pick-up or a truck which does not have four-wheel-drive). Predictable interruptions of short duration during inclement weather (e.g. heavy rainfall) are accepted, particularly on low volume roads. It is important to determine whether access to facilities and services is available all year round, and hence the possibility of the road throughout the year is an essential factor in this aspect of contributing to poverty reduction. Information on the condition of the road network is frequently maintained by road agencies as part of their operational responsibilities. The traditional road inventory survey can collect data on road condition, including the International Roughness Index (IRI), at a high level of information quality, to determine whether a road is  all-season . For the purpose of the RAI, the road condition threshold is generally set at an IRI of less than 6 meters/km for paved roads, and an IRI of less than 13 meters/km for unpaved roads. When IRI is not available, other types of condition assessment may be used if comparable.  The use of smartphones with GPS are being investigated in order to accurately map local transport services routes, and identify which rural roads are open all year and hence are all-season roads. Comments and limitations:The Indicator relies substantially on data collected by road agencies and national statistics offices for their operational work. As such, its update is dependent on the frequency of update of the road condition surveys and national census. When these data sets are not from the same year, the basic principle to be followed is that a more stable data set should be used with more flexibility. For instance, a national rural roads program could dramatically improve the quality of roads in a certain locality in a relatively short term, while population data are fairly stable over five years. In such a case, the road quality data would be considered as an anchor, with the closest or adjusted population data applied.The Indicator depends heavily on the quality of the underlying spatial data. The extent of the road network data, and how well it reflects the reality on the ground, can be a particular issue. More data are always better. Efforts are required to collect detailed road data, including tertiary or feeder roads, which may not be covered in the existing spatial road network data regardless of whether government or open data sources are used. The condition of the missing roads, however, matters; if the missing tertiary and feeder are of poor quality, their exclusion would not impact the overall results. For obvious reasons, the 2 km norm of access may not be as applicable in all areas. In Africa, for instance, a 5 km access band may make more sense given the low population density in many regions. However, for global consistency purposes and comparability across countries, the 2 km threshold has been maintained (equivalent to a 20-30 minute walk).While the RAI provides an objective benchmark for assessing access to transport in rural areas,  universal  access should not be set as a target. Where individual households are in very remote areas, attempting to reach 100% access would lead to inefficient allocation of resources. MethodologyComputation Method:The indicator is calculated by overlying three basic geospatial datasets: population distribution, road location, and road condition. The RAI is calculated as the rural population within a 2 km buffer of a good road divided by the total rural population of the country. First, the spatial distribution of the rural population needs to be determined. This involves obtaining the population dataset for the country, either from country sources or global datasets such as WorldPop. Next, the road network should be merged with road condition assessments, either in terms of IRI if available, or visual assessment. Those roads with a quality not meeting the threshold of the RAI (not providing  all-season  access) should be excluded. In general, the RAI adopts a road condition threshold is generally set at an IRI of less than 6 meters/km for paved roads and an IRI of less than 13 meters/km for unpaved roads. If IRI is unavailable, alternative assessments of road condition may be used, if comparable. A 2 km buffer should be generated around the road network meeting the condition threshold. Urban areas should be removed from both the road data and the population data. Finally, the rural population living within the 2 km buffer should be calculated. The final RAI is determined by dividing this portion of the rural population from the total rural population."
